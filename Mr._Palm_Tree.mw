{{Proposed}}

'''Mr. Palm Tree''' is a proposed badguy in the [[Tropical Island]]. He is made of three to five segments. If Tux lands on the top segment, the bottom segment is squished. Through repeated squishes, Tux can kill Mr. Palm Tree.

Mr. Palm Tree could spawn [[Nutty]] badguys, but that might be a job for a different badguy...Mr. Coconut Tree?
