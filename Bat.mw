Behaviour: zigzag flight, eats Ants - Can zero in on Tux

Look: A Bat

Hurt Tux: like Snowball

Hurt it: jump or spit

== Alternative ==
Flutters up and down, upon seeing Tux dives and tries to catch him (much like [[Zeekling]]).

Perhaps in Ghost Forest, a Spooky Mr Tree could, when jumped on, release bats instead of Poison Ivies. They could fly straight up into the air, then zoom in on Tux. If Tux dodges the could hurt they ground and get stunned, ay which point Tux could jump on them.
