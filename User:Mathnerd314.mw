I'm currently trying to write a converter for [http://www.ticalc.org/pub/83plus/asm/games/levels/mario/ these mario levels] that run under [http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/192/19225.html this mario calculator game] to get a huge source of levels for SuperTux. I'll post the converter (written in Java) and my pick of the converted levels once I get it done.
