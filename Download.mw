== SuperTux ==

To download SuperTux, you can choose from two types of packages:

* The '''[[Download/Stable|stable package]]''' contains a playable SuperTux that should not suffer from critical bugs and has had much testing. If you simply want to play the game this is the package for you.

* The '''[[Download/Unstable|unstable package]]''' contains a playable SuperTux that may suffer from critical bugs and has not been fully tested, but does sport newly added features. This package is for showing off and testing new features and levels, so don't expect it to be good, fun, well-balanced game. Be warned that it may not work well on your system, if at all. If you simply want to play the game use the stable package instead; if you are a SuperTux expert and want to experiment with the new features, you might want to try this version. Package managers and repositories should not include this package unless it is slotted beside the stable version.

Or if you are interested in developing SuperTux:

* The '''[[Download/Subversion|Subversion repository]]''' contains SuperTux in a state of development. This means new features and a large amount of bugs. If you are interested in the development of SuperTux, feel like contributing or just simply want to try out the new features and you are ready to endure some bugs and crashes, this is what you want. If you have never played SuperTux before and are interested in developing SuperTux, it is recommended you try out the stable package first.
