The '''next developer's meeting''' will (probably) be held on ''Saturday, April&nbsp;10<sup>th</sup>'' starting at ''15:00&nbsp;UCT''. Anybody interested in ''SuperTux'' is invited to participate. The discussion will be held on IRC, network ''freenode'', channel ''#supertux''. Minutes of the meeting will be made available at [[Meeting 2010-04-10]].

The following are topics we would like to discuss. Since it's possible that we cannot address all the below issues, we might postpone some issues for a later meeting.

# Project management
#* remaxim is licensing his sounds under only CC-BY-SA 3.0. According to [http://opengameart.org/content/arent-cc-and-cc-sa-incompatible-gpl], this is fine with the FSF and Debian; is it ok with us, or are we requiring GPL licensing? (which according to remaxim doesn't make any sense for sounds)
#* fyretux is making lots of levels; are there any specific critiques of them so he can improve?
# Gameplay
#* Badguys
#** [[Haywire]], [[Short Fuse]], [[Owl]], and [[SkyDive]] have been implemented by [[User:Octo|octo]]. He'd like to get some feedback.
#** Basic [[Snowman]] code exists, but the body simply disappears after he's hit. A graphic of only his body is needed.
#** [[Krush]] (2x2 icecrusher) has been implemented. What about his big brother, [[Krosh]]? Which size? What graphics? (Resize existing graphics?)
#** What [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Enemies|badguys]] to implement next?
#* Supertux Accessibility: is support for visually impaired gamers feasible?
#** How could such a support look like? Something like zooming the graphics so they are displayed larger? --[[User:Octo|octo]] 01:18, 6 March 2010 (UTC)
#** I guess this is about http://lists.lethargik.org/pipermail/supertux-devel-lethargik.org/2010-March/002847.html --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 17:19, 6 March 2010 (UTC)
# Source code
#* Split physics, drawing, etc. apart
#** Which design pattern to use?
#* Find some way to change object constants without recompiling (sprites, Yeti bounds, velocities of various things, â€¦)
#* Proposal - merge src and data of objects/enemies together so that all content is in only a single folder (i.e., folder data/mrtree/ would contain mrtree.?pp, mrtree.sprite, mrtree.ogg, left-*.png, etc.)
#** Slightly harder to build and distribute packages (exclude *.?pp from data directory in binary builds)
#** Easier to take out/add objects, because there's less to keep track of
#* Switch to some physics engine?
#** Features needed for everything to work:
#**# tilemaps (or a good broadphase and efficient collision data format)
#**# static constraint solver (so Tux doesn't get stuck on tile edges; problem in Box2D/Chipmunk)
#**# raycasting (ispy)
#**# kinematic objects (HitResponse FORCE_MOVE)
#**# AABB queries (Drawing to screen)
#**# custom collision callbacks/handlers/listeners/filters (all that collision code in MovingObject)
#**# wheel joints (bicycle platform, unused except for test levels)
#**# sliding joints (pneumatic platform, also only a test level)
#**# path constraints/motors (for moving tilemaps/platforms)
