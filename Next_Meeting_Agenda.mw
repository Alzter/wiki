The '''next developer's meeting''' will be held on ''Saturday, February&nbsp;27<sup>th</sup>'' starting at ''15:00&nbsp;UCT''. Anybody interested in ''SuperTux'' is invited to participate. The discussion will be held on IRC, network ''freenode'', channel ''#supertux''. Minutes of the meeting will be made available at [[Meeting 2010-02-27]].

The following are topics we would like to discuss. Since it's possible that we cannot address all the below issues, we might postpone some issues for a later meeting.

== Discussion ==

# Project management
#* (Unstable) Release - how?
#** [[User:Octo|octo]] has a release tarball that needs testing.
#** Tasks to be done (by who?):
#*** Upload tarball to file server (Berlios? Google? Lethargik?)
#*** Update download page http://supertux.lethargik.org/download.html
#*** Announce on ''freshmeat.net'' (Project there by AnMaster?)
#*** Update bug tracker
#*** …
#* Last chance to change [[Versioning scheme]]
#* Next meeting date and time - every Saturday at 15:00 UTC?
# Gameplay
#* Feedback for the [[Yeti]] level.
#* New tiles from grumbel - which are useful?
#* Milestone 1-like worldmap - do now or later (which ideas to keep from the new one?)
#** "Now" meaning before the release?
#** [[User:Octo|octo]] has a version of the [[Milestone 1]] worldmap in [[Milestone 2]] syntax.
#* Screw the forest? Keep for now? Don't delete ever?
#* New names for badguys. Which to rename and (if applicable) which name to use?:
#** [[Bouncing Snowball]] → Bouncy
#** [[Flying Snowball]] → Avior or Dex
#** [[Kamikaze Snowball]] → Snowshot
#** [[Mr. Bomb]] → Fuse
#** [[Jumpy]] → Recoil
# Source code
#* Split physics, drawing, etc. apart
#** Which design pattern to use?
#* Find some way to change object constants without recompiling (sprites, Yeti bounds, velocities of various things, …)
#* Proposal - merge src and data of objects/enemies together so that all content is in only a single folder (i.e., folder data/mrtree/ would contain mrtree.?pp, mrtree.sprite, mrtree.ogg, left-*.png, etc.)
#** Slightly harder to build and distribute packages (exclude *.?pp from data directory in binary builds)
#** Easier to take out/add objects, because there's less to keep track of
#* Switch to some physics engine?
#** Features needed for everything to work:
#**# tilemaps (or a good broadphase and efficient collision data format)
#**# static constraint solver (so Tux doesn't get stuck on tile edges; problem in Box2D/Chipmunk)
#**# raycasting (ispy)
#**# kinematic objects (HitResponse FORCE_MOVE)
#**# AABB queries (Drawing to screen)
#**# custom collision callbacks/handlers/listeners/filters (all that collision code in MovingObject)
#**# wheel joints (bicycle platform, unused except for test levels)
#**# sliding joints (pneumatic platform, also only a test level)
#**# path constraints/motors (for moving tilemaps/platforms)
