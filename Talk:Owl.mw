I decided to start contributing to supertux by drawing an adequate sprite for owl, but I have some serious problems actually getting them online. I repeatedly tried to create an account on the bug tracker, but never received a confirmation e-mail. So I signed up here but still can't upload my graphics (No permission to create a new page). Help?

See https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=779 Also why don't you upload it to your webspace and send a link to the mailing list? The bugtracker is full of alpha version of contrib levels and  suggested images. Most of them should be removed right away. --[[Special:Contributions/46.4.237.146|46.4.237.146]] 14:18, 21 May 2011 (UTC)
