I decided to start contributing to supertux by drawing an adequate sprite for owl, but I have some serious problems actually getting them online. I repeatedly tried to create an account on the bug tracker, but never received a confirmation e-mail. So I signed up here but still can't upload my graphics (No permission to create a new page). Help?
