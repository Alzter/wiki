{{PD Help Page}}
You can obtain a copy of the help system in this wiki for local use in your own wiki following these steps:

* Step one: In a separate browser window, navigate to [[Special:Export]].
* Step two: You will see an open textbox asking you for a list of pages to export.
* Step three: Copy the list below and paste it into that textbox. This is a generally useful set, making the resulting help structure in your wiki look almost identical to the one here.

 [[Help:Contents]]
 [[Help:Navigation]]
 [[Help:Searching]]
 [[Help:Tracking_changes]]
 [[Help:Editing_pages]]
 [[Help:Starting_a_new_page]]
 [[Help:Formatting]]
 [[Help:Links]]
 [[Help:Categories]]
 [[Help:Images]]
 [[Help:Templates]]
 [[Help:Tables]]
 [[Help:Variables]]
 [[Help:Managing_files]]
 [[Help:Preferences]]

* Step four: Make sure the box "Include only the current revision, not the full history" is CHECKED.
* Step five: Click the 'Export' button.
* Step six: Save the file to your desktop or other convenient location you'll remember.
* Step seven: Navigate to Special:Import on YOUR wiki. (You must be logged in as Admin/Sysop level to do this.)
* Step eight: Browse for the file you saved, and click 'Upload'.

That should do it!  Although not complete, at least this gets you started on a decent help system.


==Automated copying==

If you use pywikipedia, there is a script to automate the copying at http://mediawiki-tools.cvs.sourceforge.net/mediawiki-tools/pywikipedia/mirrorhelp.py, which copies all pages in the help namespace along with templates and images directly referenced by those.
