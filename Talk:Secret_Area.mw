Instead of changing the way Secret Area work, just use another sector for your well hidden secret area and beam tux in and out using a script.

Do you know how hard it actually is make teleportation work smoothly?  Look in the ML for my "Lost Woods" concept level, change the music for the ambientsound, and play it.  I still haven't gotten it totally smooth.  Most teleport usage has a fade-in/fade-out, or a lightning strike as misdirection.  You really do not want to fade-in/fade-out, and lightning may not be appropriate.  Oh yeah, sign your comments with four tildes. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 16:30, 26 Jul 2006 (BST)
