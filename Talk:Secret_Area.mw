Instead of changing the way Secret Area work, just use another sector for your well hidden secret area and beam tux in and out using a script.

Do you know how hard it actually is make teleportation work smoothly?  Look in the ML for my "Lost Woods" concept level, change the music for the ambientsound, and play it.  I still haven't gotten it totally smooth.  Most teleport usage has a fade-in/fade-out, or a lightning strike as misdirection.  You really do not want to fade-in/fade-out, and lightning may not be appropriate.  Oh yeah, sign your comments with four tildes. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 16:30, 26 Jul 2006 (BST)

== Secret area are counted ==

''"The Secret Area Trigger is used to mark secret areas, at the moment it doesn't do more then writing a message, it however could also be used to count the number of secrets the player has found in a world (even so that is probally better done with special coins or items to collect)."''
:This is wrong, those areas are counted. Look for a string like "Secrets found 1/2" at the end of a level. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 16:34, 26 Jul 2006 (BST)

== Rectangular secretarea-triggers might not be flexible enough ==

Why not just use polygons or maybe name secret areas so that several secert areas with the same name are treated as one area? I dislike using tiles for it. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 20:09, 27 Jul 2006 (BST)
