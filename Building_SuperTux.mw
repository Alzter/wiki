{{Milestone 2}}
= Some notes for windows users =

Supertux development mainly happens on Linux. The source code is written in a portable manner but the tools and development environment for windows isn't there (yet?). However you should be able to get the game built with the help of msys. Find more detailed instructions at [[Building on Windows]].

= Mac OS X =

[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu al Hemio]] has written a [[User:RavuAlHemio/Mac_OS_X_compilation|guide]] for Mac OS X Tiger users on building SuperTux.

= Prerequisites =

You will need the following tools and libraries to build SuperTux on your system:
