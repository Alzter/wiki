= Some notes for windows users =

Supertux development mainly happens on linux. The sourcecode is written in a portable manner but the tools and development environment for windows isn't there (yet?). However you should be able to get the game built with the help of msys. Find more detailed instructions at [[Building on Windows]].

= Mac OS X =

[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu al Hemio]] has written a [[User:RavuAlHemio/Mac_OS_X_compilation|guide]] for Mac OS X Tiger users on building SuperTux.

= Prerequesites =

You will need the following tools and libraries to build SuperTux on your system:
* gcc compiler &co (gcc, g++, binutils, glibc)
* gettext
* autoconf
* jam
* SDL (*)
* SDL-image (*)
* PhysFS (*)
* Ogg/Vorbis (*)
* OpenGL (*)
* OpenAL (*)

You should make sure that you also have development headers and libraries installed for the tools marked with (*).

Most distributions offer separate developer versions for these libraries:

== Debian ==
Debian users should run
 apt-get install subversion autoconf jam g++ 
 apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libphysfs-dev libvorbis-dev libogg-dev libopenal-dev
to install them.

== Gentoo ==
Gentoo users should run
 emerge -av subversion jam openal physfs libsdl sdl-image libvorbis libogg

= Getting the source =

The first thing to get started with supertux is getting the latest development resources from the subversion repository. How to do this is described here at [[Download/Subversion]].

= Configuring the source =

Before compiling the sourcecode you have to configure it so that it gets adapted to your machine. Use the following commands:

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure --enable-debug

configure checks if all prerequisits are met.

= Compiling the source =

You can compile the sourcecode from commandline with the help of jam. Simply type

 jam

and the game should build. You should [[SuperTux FAQ#How_can_I_get_in_touch_with_you.3F|Contact]] us in case of errors or problems.

= Setting up IDEs =

This section is under construction. IDEs that should be able to handle supertux include:

* KDevelop
* Eclipse with CDT

= Compiling the editor =

== Setup ==

To compile the editor you should make sure that you have some additional dependencies available:

* An already compiled and working svn version of supertux
* mono 1.1.13 or newer
* gtk-sharp 2.8
* gtk-sourceview-sharp 2.8

=== Debian ===

Debian users can run the following command to do this:
 apt-get install mono mono-gmcs gtk-sharp2

=== Gentoo ===

Gentoo users can use this command:
 emerge -av ">=dev-lang/mono-1.1.13" ">=dev-dotnet/gtk-sharp-2.8.0" ">=dev-dotnet/glade-sharp-2.8.0"
Unmask any packages that might be needed on your arch (none needed on either x86 or amd64).

=== Generic ===

If you have to use the generic installer from the web, be warned that neither the stable(1.1.13) or current(1.1.15_2) have the correct version for gtk-sharp. The recommended way to resolve this is:

1.  Install mono using an all-in-one generic installer

The all-in-one installer will try to adjust your enviroment through the .bashrc file.  This is not a proper system-wide change, so (in Slackware at least) modify these scripts and place them in /etc/profile.d

mono.csh

 #!/bin/csh
 setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH {$PKG_CONFIG_PATH}:/path/to/mono/lib/pkgconfig
 setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:/path/to/mono/share/man
 setenv PATH ${PATH}:/path/to/mono/bin

mono.sh

 #!/bin/sh
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/path/to/mono/lib/pkgconfig"
 export MANPATH="$MANPATH:/path/to/mono/share/man"
 export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/mono/bin"

Also, add /path/to/mono/lib in /etc/ld.so.conf
You may have to login again after these changes so they can take affect.

2.  Download the source of gtk-sharp at go-mono.com/sources-latest/

3.  Compile and install gtk-sharp using "./configure --prefix==/path/to/mono"

4.  Verify that the new version is correct by running "pkg-config --modversion gtk-sharp-2.0" (May need to login again for this)

== Building ==

You can compile the editor from commandline with jam. Simply type
 
 jam

and the editor will be built. You can then start the editor with

 mono supertux-editor.exe

There are also complete monodevelop project files for the editor in the svn. (TODO write about the hacks needed to actually compile the source in monodevelop).
