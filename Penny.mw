We decided that Penny should be the name of [[Tux|Tux's]] girlfriend. Though Gown is slightly more popular (a couple of games use it), we found that it didn't sound very well.

Toward the end of the game, [[Tux]] should be captured in order to save Penny from [[Nolok]].  At this point the player should play as Penny, trying to save Tux and stop him from Nolok's evil mind control.

The images below are sketches which are basic sketches of how Penny should be portrayed:
