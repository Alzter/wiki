Hi, I tried using jam that comes with the Developer Tools (/Developer/Private/jam), but I receive an error: "Missing file or directory: all".  Compiling jam with fink and using that works well however.  Not sure if the version that comes with Developer Tools is too old (I have the newest Developer Tools (v 2.2) though).  I can't tell which version of jam Developer Tools uses though as it doesn't respect the usual GNU options (-v, -h, etc).

Also wondering if you know of a way or have a howto on how to make a .app bundle from supertux?  I've tried just moving the binary into a .app and can get it to work (with plist modifications), but I doubt it will work on other systems without the appropriate frameworks (OpenAL, OpenGL, ogg, vorbis, physfs) installed.  I'm assuming they can be bundled into the .app as with version 1.3, but I'm unsure how to do this.

Thanks, great guide!

I am doing great too... but can't get configure to recognize SDL_Image... when I KNOW I installed it. Help?

Did you install it to the default PREFIX?  If you used a package manager like Fink it may install it to a different directory and you'll have to tell configure where it's located.


In case anyone runs into the same problems I did, here's a modification that worked for me:
First, on my MacBook Pro (never had this on my Powerbook), I run into errors not finding OpenAL.  I had to link AL to /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenAL.framework/Versions/A/Headers/ (as the symlink for Headers points to Current instead of A, and the folder/link Current doesn't exist).  I also had to remove a directory in /Library/Frameworks/OpenAL.framework (possibly installed when I ran into the first problem and tried to install the framework from http developer.creative.com/articles/article.asp?cat=1&sbcat=31&top=38&aid=97).

For some reason the Jamfile didn't take the -framework OpenAL flag so jam can't find OpenAL when linking.  I had to run jam as so:
LDFLAGS="-framework OpenAL -L." jam

Also, if you're using Fink, I've been running configure as so:
./configure --with-apple-opengl-framework CPPFLAGS="-I. $CPPFLAGS" LDFLAGS="-framework OpenAL $LDFLAGS"
(make sure to follow Fink's instructions on having your .bashrc set the proper CPP and LDFLAGS: http fink.sourceforge.net/faq/usage-general.php (question Q8.3)).

Something very interesting happened jam failed on to find parser not because it was named parser.cpp.h but because it wasnt named parser.cpp.h !!!
