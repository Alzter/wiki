== Repository ==
Supertux development is coordinated with the help of the subversion version control system. Simply spoken it's filestore that can be used by multiple users simultaneously and which keeps track of changes and keeps old versions of files archived. You can find out more about subversion in general on their homepage at [http://subversion.tigris.org]

== Getting the repository (anonymous read only access) ==
Anonymous read access to the repository is granted for everybody. So when you already have subversion isntalled all you have to do to get your hands on the source is to use the following command:

 svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/supertux/trunk/supertux

This will create a new directory supertux which contains the latest versions of the supertux sourcecode. Once you have checked out the sources you can use

 svn update

inside the supertux directory to update to the latest versions in the repository. This will only download changed files to save bandwidth.

== Creating Patches ==

Once you have done some own changes on the repository and want to contribute them to supertux you have to create a patch (since the public repository is read only). The following steps walk you through the process of creating a patch:

At first you should use

 svn status

this will print you a list of files with a prefix letter. M means you have changed the file, C means there has been a conflict between your changes and changes from someone else in the repository, ? means the file is ignored by the version control.

You should fix all conflicts, and use '''svn add''' to add files that you created and which should be under version control. '''svn remove''' will remove files from version control. Finally you can create a patch by using

 svn diff > mypatch.patch

This will create a file mypatch.patch that contains all changes you did to the repository. You should send your patch to the [Mailinglist].

== Web Access ==
If you just want to browse through the source a bit, then you can use the [http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/supertux/trunk/supertux/ Repository HTTP Interface] to browse the repository using your web browser.

== Developer SVN access ==
