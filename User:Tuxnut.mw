[[Image:Tux pwn.png|right]]Helloes. I currently can't play SuperTux, although I used to (and I enjoyed it :) until I had some computer issues. Oh well, I'm trying to get it back up, because some of the new levels and features I'm seeing on ViewVC are making me drool. I'm willing to contribute a few wiki-based fixes, and possibly some music. I might also be preparing an online level editor with JavaScript and PHP, in the far future...
