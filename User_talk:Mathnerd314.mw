== Reply to problems with editor ==

No I won't support level editor in java (I don't know java, and some other reasons), as for error message from current editor please:
# Check [[Editor FAQ#Bugs and Errors]]
# If nothing is found there, ask on mailing list or file a bug. In both cases include full error message (and any backtrace you got) and all the other info listed at [[Editor FAQ#My bug is not listed above]]

== Converter? ==

Hm... You mention a converter on your user page, as I got a TI-83+ and I once played a mario game on it I assume it is the same mario game (there can't be two for TI83+, I refuse to believe that ;). As far as I remember, the game wasn't very good. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 15:35, 19 October 2007 (UTC)
