Still nothing to see...

No I won't support level editor in java (I don't know java, and some other reasons), as for error message from current editor please:
# Check [[Editor FAQ#Bugs and Errors]]
# If nothing is found there, ask on mailing list or file a bug. In both cases include full error message (and any backtrace you got) and all the other info listed at [[Editor FAQ#My bug is not listed above]]
