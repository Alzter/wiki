This could be useful in underwater levels.

Before implementing swimming there are some details that need to be specified:

* What can tux do in water?

Swim left, swim right, dive.

Tux could be able to move a lot faster in water than on land, and he could be able to jump higher when jumping out of a pool of water - like real penguins.

* How does he leave the pool, ie. how high can Tux jump while swimming?

* What happens to existing levels, especially in situations where the water is on the bottom of a shaft with no way to climb out?

== Breathing ==
I don't know if penguins can breath underwater, but maybe Tux need swim to surface to breath sometimes...
* They can hold their breaths for up to 12 minutes. Good enough?
