How could I update SuperTux to the last version without svn, just with repository inserted in sources.list? --<small style="background:#f00">'''[[User:Airon90|<span style="color:#000">→ A</span>]][[Special:Contributions/Airon90|<span style="color:#f00;background:#000">ir</span>]][[User talk:Airon90|<span style="color:#000">on Ĉ</span>]]'''</small> 21:31, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

== PPA repository for Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) ==

I'd be grateful for extendind the PPA repository to Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) - especially that it's an LTS release and can be used for up to 3 years. Thanks in advance. [[User:M gol|m_gol]] 20:39, 3 May 2010 (UTC)
:I am doing so right now. Sorry for the delay, but my internet was upgraded from 768 kbit down / 384 kbit up to 12 mbit down / 1.5 mbit up yesterday. I was waiting for that to take place so it wouldn't take so long to upload. -[[User:Some Person|Some Person]] 21:20, 5 May 2010 (UTC)

== SVN repo for Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick) ==

Just asking: are there any plans to include Supertux SVN PPA repository also for Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick) or will it only remain available for 10.04 LTS? (I just have to consider if I want to upgrade) [[User:M gol|m_gol]] 23:13, 15 October 2010 (UTC)
:You have to ask the Ubuntu team about that. I hope they ship stable stuff and not some unfinished svn snapshot. If you want unstable Supertux get the distribution independent autopackage. --[[User:Queser|Queser]] 23:15, 16 October 2010 (UTC)
::They ship package supertux-stable which is Supertux 0.1.3 and supertux which is version 0.3.3. Nonetheless, I was just asking about an SVN PPA for Supertux (one is already maintained for Lucid). [[User:M gol|m_gol]] 17:30, 19 October 2010 (UTC)
