I now propose a forest boss (which I think is better than ghost tree)...Sasquatch:
[[Image:Bigfoot.png|It's Chewbacca!]]

He would function like the Yeti, except have more of a roar than a gna. As Sasquatches and Yeti are very similar (both mythical creatures of the same family), I think that this would be a fun addition to the forest. Please discuss it on its talk page.
