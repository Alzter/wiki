I had to install one additional package in order to get SuperTux to compile -- the MinGW gcc-g++ package for compiling C++ code, found [hxxp://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/gcc-g++-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz?download here]. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]]

When I want to compile SuperTux on windows xp, i get an error because the sourcefile addon_manager.cpp needs LIBCURL... but i don't know where i can find the right LIBCURL-package for windows and how to install it (with MSYS ...) please update this page.. - [[User:TowelieDasTuch|TowelieDasTuch]]

Note that we don't have a windows maintainer and most developers have better things to do than rebooting to windows. Motivation is a bit low to keep stuff compiling on windows just for the sake of other people playing svn versions... Basically: Please try a little harder fixing it yourself! --[[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]] 20:34, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

== DLLs needed ==

SuperTux seems to run fine with only the following DLLs in place
* libogg-0.dll
* libphysfs-1-0-0.dll
* SDL.dll
* SDL_image.dll
Further investigation necessary
