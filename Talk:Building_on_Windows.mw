I had to install one additional package in order to get SuperTux to compile -- the MinGW gcc-g++ package for compiling C++ code, found [hxxp://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/gcc-g++-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz?download here]. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]]

== DLLs needed ==

SuperTux seems to run fine with only the following DLLs in place
* libogg-0.dll
* libphysfs-1-0-0.dll
* SDL.dll
* SDL_image.dll
Further investigation necessary
