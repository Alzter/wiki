So yeah, it is true that interaction at the main menu causes it to crash. I can't go to any actual level.
Is this only a problem in windows? Is there a way to manually load a level?

This problem has happened only on windows so far. Though I suspect it is bad OpenAl usage from our side. Anyway I don't plan to spend more debugging on this anytime soon. What you can do as a workaround is specifying level files directly on the commandline, so you can see them...

:The main menu and everything seems to work fine for me on latest SVN (2006-04-05) - 04:17, 6 Apr 2006 (BST)

I had to install one additional package in order to get SuperTux to compile -- the MinGW gcc-g++ package for compiling C++ code, found [http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/gcc-g++-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz?download here].
