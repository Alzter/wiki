I really like your inventory, bat, and beach world ideas. --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 15:35, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

I like all your ideas. However, in the inventory, you talked about no more bigtux. I think that bigtux looks better than little tux. For the inventory, when you currently start as littletux, you should start as bigtux with one penguin heart. Then instead of an egg/powerup bonus box, there would be a heart/powerup bonus box. (you would need 2 penguin hearts to get a powerup. When you got a powerup, then you gained another penguin heart and kept it until you lost the powerup.)
