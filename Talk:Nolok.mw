==Just a Though==
I like the most the furry one Nolok.. it shouln't be so close to Bowser, it is not funny just to be a redone clone of him.. I think it would fit more if it were furry and look like a feline, a evil and big cat who likes to play with birds like penguins.. of course it could have an armor and all that so it would end up looking simmilar to those graphics, but just with a different look so it doesnt turn in a "Bowser falsification".. It is nice that SuperTux was based on SuperMario.. but I think it can be more than a pure clone --[[User:Ferk|Ferk]] 23:24, 11 Aug 2006 (BST)
