[[Image:Ice flower.png|right|The iceflower symbol]]
The '''iceflower''' will give [[Tux]] the [[Actions|ability]] to shoot ice bullets. Ice bullets will not bounce like [[Fireflower|fire bullets]], but will shoot out in a straight path towards the enemy. When the ice bullet hits an enemy it will freeze him for a short time, if the enemy [[:Category:Freezable badguys|is freezable]].

Perhaps the ice bullet could freeze water, bouncing across the surface of a body of the aforesaid liquid and freezing the surface of the '''one block''' it touches, and maybe one block either side of it. I got the idea from water -> ice on the User Ideas page.
