The '''iceflower''' will give [[Tux]] the [[Actions|ability]] to shoot ice bullets. Ice bullets will not bounce like [[Fireflower|fire bullets]], but will shoot out in a straight path towards the enemy. When the ice bullet hits an enemy it will freeze him for a short time, if the enemy is freezable.

== Graphic Proposal ==

Its just an idea i didnt discuss with anybody yet and Im relatively new to this wiki, so I didnt remove tho NeedGraphics for now.
