==The colourblind issue==
An issue that might or might not be relevant: colourblind people would be unable to tell the difference between a red block and a green block, being unable to play eg. light+magic.stl, or even unable to see any colour in coloured blocks. This was not an issue in MS1, since this feature was not present.
