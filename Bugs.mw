This page lists all known bugs. Feel free to elaborate on any bugs already noted here. Please make a note if a bug has either been fixed or not been fixed (in an old release).

== Website ==
All website bugs have been fixed.

== Release 0.1.3 ==
* If an enemy kills [[Tux]] and the user elects to abort the level before he falls off the screen, gameplay may continue with negative lives.
* The texture.cpp file has an incorrect texture type (GL_RGB10_A2). Only ATI (FGLRX) drivers will interpret it correctly and will display a non-transparent waterfall in OpenGL. It's better to use GL_RGBA here since most drivers (ex. mesa) interpret GL_RGB10_A2 as GL_RGBA
* Widely experienced bug: After compiling v0.1.3 from source on Ubuntu Linux 5.10 "Breezy Badger", the game crashes after choosing "Bonus Levels" from the main menu, although going into a 26-level game slot doesn't. -djwings
* I was able to walk throug the end of the level without finishing it. It happend while playing witw 12 frames/seconds.
* The jumping heads with spikes sometimes only jump to the level of a passing cloud.
* Enter key is completely ignored on a Compaq Pressario, but works fine with other SDL-based games (e.g. Falcon's Eye) (by jessejoe)
** Can be worked around by custom-compiling with all SDLK_RETURN replaced by 271
* Tux is unable to grab Mr. Iceblock while blinking after losing a bonus (eg. Big Tux -> Small Tux).
* The Mac OS X version seems to have some transparency problems in OpenGL mode. eg. you can easily see the 'hidden' coins at the end of the first level.
* supertux doesn't compile with gcc-4.1.1. At line 210 of menu.h the 'Menu::' qualification needs to be removed (it is already a Menu:: member and this is no longer allowed in gcc-4.1.1).
=== Not a bug ===
* After running the configure script without any options and compiling the source in the supertux-0.1.3.tar file, SuperTux crashes with the error 'Couldn't load musicfile', and reports the filename with a complete absolute path (which is correct -- SALCON.mod). Bug produced with a Slackware 9.1 system. -> Your SDL_mixer library is probably compiled without mikmod support or you grabbed 1 of the versions where mikmod support was broken.
* Tux can junt to the top and out of the screen when a platform reaches the upper limit. This allowa to bypass certain zones.
** Intended behaviour
* If you have the big Tux, hit a box with a flower and then for some reason you are attacked and reverted to the small Tux, when picking up the flower you'll be big Tux in fire mode.
** Intended behaviour
*Enemies need not to fall down from the platforms. This reduces enemy number.
**Eremm... This happens in many Mario games.
**Anyway. Not a bug. If this was a feature request, please add this to the list of [[Ideas]]
**Isn't this is a badguy characteristic?  Some badguys fall off, others don't.  --tuxdev

== Release 0.1.2 ==
* The sound slightly lags. Bug produced with Fedora Core 2.
* If an enemy kills [[Tux]] and the user elects to abort the level before he falls off the screen, gameplay may continue with negative lives.
* When opening hand-edited levels/maps that have incorrect syntax, SuperTux crashes with an unmoveable mouse.
* SuperTux takes up more memory on each new level/game, until it crashes the systems. Using KDE System Guard suggests that finished maps/levels are not being freed from memory. Bug produced on a Knoppix/Debian system with 128MB of RAM.

== Development version ==

=== Closed ===

* Revision 3641. Some platforms stop just above or below where it should. According to delta___ the bug should happen with pretty much any platform that moves fast enough and stops at an uneven part of it's speed.
** Fixed in some revision I can't find the number of right now.

* 3657: Jamfile builds too long link command line, causing it to fail. Maybe disregarding the arch might help.
** when exactly does this happen?
** seem common on x64 boxes. They pass an arch of "foobar-unknown-baz-blah-blubb" which (gets included in each build action's path and) bloats the command line to exceed 10240 chars. Workaround is manually shortening the arch passed to the build process by running something like "./configure --build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu"
** This was fixed in r3923.

* 4034: When Tux is invincible he still squishes enemies and stuns iceblocks by jumping on their heads instead of simply killing them.
:Feature. Even as invincible Tux you can stun and grab Mr. Iceblock.
:More importantly, you can now cross gaps by jumping on e.g. [[Flying Snowball]]s

* 4034: When Firetux backflips he loses his hat and status and reverts to normal bigtux (intended behaviour?).
:Intended behaviour.

* 4075: When the game is paused, the time keeps running.
** cannot reproduce on 4076. Please give further steps to reproduce. --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 00:47, 24 Jul 2006 (BST)
** Go to 'The Frosted Fields', start it, and pause.
** Fixed in r4079 --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 15:14, 24 Jul 2006 (BST)

* 4107: Editor: Deleting a Tilemap doesn't delete the tiles in it but instead lets EVERY tile of the map loose its tilemaps so you can't edit anything anymore (can't even add new tiles)
**Fixed in r4111. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 03:36, 2 Aug 2006 (BST)

{{Attention|s=Please make sure to always specify an exact revision number with each bug report!}}
* free() errors when exiting SuperTux without having entered a worldmap/level.
** Results of [[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]]'s testing (references are of format ''file.ext:function:<code>code_line;</code>''):
*** Linux tends to scream while ''resources.cpp:unload_shared:<code>delete gold_text;</code>'' at ''video/texture.cpp:~Texture:<code>glDeleteTextures(1, &handle);</code>''
*** Mac screams while ''main.cpp:main:<code>delete script_manager;</code>'' at ''squirrel/squirrel/sqclosure.h:Release:<code>sq_delete(this,SQNativeClosure);</code>''
** Cannot reproduce. Are these still relevant?

* Mac OS X on Intel: dock icon looks wacky. This is an SDL problem; will submit a bug report ASAP.

* 3657: Infoboxes cause "Restarting audio source because of buffer underrun" errors
** that's because they do their own eventloop, they really should plug into MainLoop somehow

* 3771: Possible to die after winning a level if not invincible (happens in yeti level)

* 4033: Dart traps sometimes shoot right through walls, instead of hitting them.
** Seems to happen when a dart hits near the border between two tiles

* 4041: Tux gets stuck for a few seconds climbing certain staircases in the level that's automatically played in the background on the main menu.
:yes at x 3762 y 256 and x 8288 y 1024, and sometimes other places too.

* 4076: Cannot get to 'Forest World'.

* 4087: Getting an icicle to fall on a snowball no longer kills the snowball. (Even if that's intended, I kinda liked that feature...)

* 4107: Editor: Placing a left-switch is difficult, the switch moves to the left in the game compared to the editor.

* 4107: Big Tux dies when exiting some doors, (e.g. in world2/level1.stl, near the first secret area) possibly because he's spawned in the ground.

* 4107: Enemies may be pushed in the ground by other objects (e.g. in world2/updown.stl, near the beginning, the snail may be pushed underground by the platform).

* 4107: Tux can get stuck in the "roof" of data/levels/world2/level2.stl at x 4160, y 656.001 when the level is flipped. Slopes still doesn't work when level is flipped.

* 4107: Editor: When using a ScriptedObject, it doesn't matter wether or not it's selected solid or not - it's allways solid. Beside, tux doesn't really stand on it but *hovers* slightly above it, falling THROUGH the object after 1-2 seconds (again no matter if it's solid or not)
[[Category:For Users]]
:This is not an editor bug, it is in ST itself.  Cause is related to ScriptedObject not being a MovingObject or MovingSprite.  I don't think ScriptedObject should even exist. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 19:08, 1 Aug 2006 (BST)
::Looks like ScriptedObject was another victim of r4076. Not sure if I got all problems fixed. Please test. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 23:47, 1 Aug 2006 (BST)

* 4107: When two slopes of opposite directions of the snow-tileset are connected to eachother on their lower side, when running from right to left it works, from left to right you get stuck.
