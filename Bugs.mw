* 4426: Console is operational during the main menu, which means you can use 'kill()' to kill Tux; the level fades out and does not fade back in again, resulting in a quiet, black background with the main menu (which still works).
*: The console is a debugging tool, you can mess up any game using it as you can call any function that you could call using a script. And as normal users would never use the console I don't think that this seems like an important bug. Also having the console reachable from anywhere in the game is good for debugging (and that is what the console is meant for, it isn't for cheating...). --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 12:25, 29 Oct 2006 (CET)
*: Not a bug.

* If you jump through a non-solid block into a solid one, you go through the solid blocks. (This is kind of hard to explain. We need a site where we can post levels to demonstrate bugs...)
*: You might be experiencing a new feature of ST engine, unisolid tiles.  Example level is "Detour", for the tree branches. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 18:11, 20 Dec 2006 (CET)
*: I already knew about unisolid tiles. This wasn't a bug in supertux, just a bug in my level - I had put some foreground tiles over unisolid ones thinking they were just plain solid tiles next time I looked at that level.

* 4328, 0_3_x branch: crash when trying to load "Light and Magic".
*: Works for me in 4446. Fixed or hard to reproduce? 
*:: Fixed, or at least worked around.

* 4496: Finish World1, solve a wold2 level, Quit game. Load game. Game starts on world1.

* 4496: get_light() does not work if resolution is not default
:fixed in r4541

* 4531: The pushbuttons do not work anymore. (Maybe it was the gravity patch? It worked in r4529)
: test/pushbutton.stl works as expected with r4555 

* 3657: Infoboxes cause "Restarting audio source because of buffer underrun" errors
*: that's because they do their own eventloop, they really should plug into MainLoop somehow
::Hacked for 0.3. 

* 4117: Wind with x speed 0 is really x speed -1 . in order to get tux move vertically, set x-speed to 1 (or fix it ;-D)
*:Might be related to the problem that sometimes when tux stands still and jumps, he land slightly behind where he stood before.
::Fixed in r4532

* 4249: If you jump on Poison Ivy (green thing on the ground), the leaves fly around. If you walk on the orange thing, it doesn't.
::Different Badguys behave different. Not a bug.

* 4249: In "Tree Fortress" level: sometimes when Zeekling hits first Mr Tree Mr Tree can suddenly appear on wooden border and, of course stuck there. (Quite hard to reproduce)
*: This is a general problem when badguys stack - it always looks a bit out of place. SuperTux might be better off either letting badguys walk through each other or having badguys get squished when another badguy steps on their head. --[[User:131.188.73.150|131.188.73.150]] 14:08, 26 Sep 2006 (BST)
::Badguys squish each other r4435

* Mac OS X on Intel: dock icon looks wacky. This is an SDL problem; will submit a bug report ASAP.
:No bug in supertux. 

* 4162: Error in drawing of tilemap-to-lightmap on Windows. Doesn't happen on Linux. See [[:Image:Lightmap_error_on_Windows.png|screenshot]] for details.
*: 4251: A similar thing (but not so ugly) happens on Ubuntu Dapper in world2/light+magic.stl, in the dark area near the end, when walking up/down.
*::Should be fixed with bigger lightmap in r4443.
*:::This makes that level unplayably slow for me. I think that the lightmap needs to be block-aligned (it'll need to be slightly wider and taller), with appropriate changes to the pixel lookup code.
:::Seems to go away with #define LIGHTMAP_DIV 5 instead of 4 (light lines) or 1 (too slow on some machines)

* 3771: Possible to die after winning a level if not invincible (happens in yeti level)

* 4033: Dart traps sometimes shoot right through walls, instead of hitting them.
*: Seems to happen when a dart hits near the border between two tiles

* 4041: Tux gets stuck for a few seconds climbing certain staircases in the level that's automatically played in the background on the main menu.
*:yes at x 3762 y 256 and x 8288 y 1024, and sometimes other places too.

* 4107: Editor: Placing a left-switch is difficult, the switch moves to the left in the game compared to the editor.

* 4107: Enemies may be pushed in the ground by other objects (e.g. in world2/updown.stl, near the beginning, the snail may be pushed underground by the platform if upside-down).

* 4107: Tux can get stuck in the "roof" of data/levels/world2/level2.stl at x 4160, y 656.001 when the level is flipped. Slopes still doesn't work when level is flipped.

* 4107: When two slopes of opposite directions of the snow-tileset are connected to eachother on their lower side, when running from right to left it works, from left to right you get stuck.

* 4236: When there are multiple stalactites in a row, they often disappear instead of falling (e.g. bonus2/level7.stl)

* 4245: If you switch the camera to manual mode and scroll it so that Tux would be off the screen, Tux actually gets pushed into the water by the left edge of the screen.

* 4245: Since r4208 Smalltux spawns below the spawnpoint. So reset points are no longer activated if restarting a level there. (activate firefly, kill tux. tux starts at firefly, but firefly shows inactive image)

* 4249: I found a secret bonus level on the south-west ice island, but when I won it, SuperTux crashed. SVN 23 sept. -- smallfoot-

* 4251: When Bigtux crushes a wooden box by jumping, enemies on that box do not die, but fall on his head.

* 4249: Squirrel function wait() counts real seconds, not game seconds - so cutscenes can end up deadly for Tux of time synchronisation doesn't fit. -- [[User:Penma|Penguinmaster]] 23:42, 30 Sep 2006 (CEST)

* 4327: Forest worldmap has a level off the path, and says that "tilemap data is buggy" when I get near it.--[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 15:34, 1 Oct 2006 (CEST)

* 4437: Only one Mr. Icebox will die, if two are fired at each other. (Different behaviour than in 0.1.3)

* 4438: Level time stops (and the counter at the top disappears) if you go to another sector.
