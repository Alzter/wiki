This page is for listing all known bugs, because it seems that some have been escaping peoples' attention. Feel free to elaborate on any bugs already noted here, or comment on why it's not fixed if there's a reason for it. Also note if any of these have been fixed, of course.

== Release 0.1.2 ==
* Sound lags a bit on my system (only Supertux has this problem, other games work fine - I'm using Fedora Core 2)

== Development (svn) version ==

* Semi-predictable segfaults (happen when switching into/out of a level, or out of the map)
* Missing files (arctis2.jpg, mkinstalldirs)
* Plenty of graphical glitches (there's weird flickers whenever Tux is off the top of the screen, background goes nuts on some bonus levels)
* Tux does a tiny jump when he jumps while ducking (unprecedented and pointless behavior, has killed me more than once - why do we have it?)
** You try jumping while ducking :) - sik0fewl
*** It's not any more difficult than jumping three times my height (or smashing bricks with my head, for that matter). :P - NMcCoy
*Glibc seems to have a problem: <tt>*** glibc detected *** free(): invalid pointer: 0x082e22e8 ***</tt> (Fedora Core 3 fresh install with yum update) <br> GWater: Also seen bug on Fedora3 _64, have only seen crash on Yeti_Test screen so far. glibc detected double free or corruption: 0x0000003000e2da38 Aborted<br>This is not a glibc problem, but a problmen in our code that needs to be fixed.
*Sometimes killed with no reason. Just started a level and baam killed.
**Even tho you die, you don't lose a life.
*When are you killed and you started again sometimes time does not reset.
*When I try to run 'autogen.sh' I see:
: command not found
autogen.sh: line 14: syntax error near unexpected token `|'
autogen.sh: line 14: `  | sed -e 's/configure.ac:[0-9]*:AC_SUBST:\([^:]*\).*/\1 '= "@\1@" ;/g' \

What should I do?? :-((
