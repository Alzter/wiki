This page lists all known bugs. Feel free to elaborate on any bugs already noted here. Please make a note if a bug has either been fixed or not been fixed (in an old release).

== Website ==
All website bugs have been fixed.

== Release 0.1.3 ==
* If an enemy kills [[Tux]] and the user elects to abort the level before he falls off the screen, gameplay may continue with negative lives.
* The texture.cpp file has an incorrect texture type (GL_RGB10_A2). Only ATI (FGLRX) drivers will interpret it correctly and will display a non-transparent waterfall in OpenGL. It's better to use GL_RGBA here since most drivers (ex. mesa) interpret GL_RGB10_A2 as GL_RGBA
* Widely experienced bug: After compiling v0.1.3 from source on Ubuntu Linux 5.10 "Breezy Badger", the game crashes after choosing "Bonus Levels" from the main menu, although going into a 26-level game slot doesn't. -djwings
* I was able to walk throug the end of the level without finishing it. It happend while playing witw 12 frames/seconds.
* The jumping heads with spikes sometimes only jump to the level of a passing cloud.
* Enter key is completely ignored on a Compaq Pressario, but works fine with other SDL-based games (e.g. Falcon's Eye) (by jessejoe)
** Can be worked around by custom-compiling with all SDLK_RETURN replaced by 271
* Tux is unable to grab Mr. Iceblock while blinking after losing a bonus (eg. Big Tux -> Small Tux).

=== Not a bug ===
* After running the configure script without any options and compiling the source in the supertux-0.1.3.tar file, SuperTux crashes with the error 'Couldn't load musicfile', and reports the filename with a complete absolute path (which is correct -- SALCON.mod). Bug produced with a Slackware 9.1 system. -> Your SDL_mixer library is probably compiled without mikmod support or you grabbed 1 of the versions where mikmod support was broken.
* Tux can junt to the top and out of the screen when a platform reaches the upper limit. This allowa to bypass certain zones.
** Intended behaviour
* If you have the big Tux, hit a box with a flower and then for some reason you are attacked and reverted to the small Tux, when picking up the flower you'll be big Tux in fire mode.
** Intended behaviour
*Enemies need not to fall down from the platforms. This reduces enemy number.
**Eremm... This happens in many Mario games.
**Anyway. Not a bug. If this was a feature request, please add this to the list of [[Ideas]]
**Isn't this is a badguy characteristic?  Some badguys fall off, others don't.  --tuxdev

== Release 0.1.2 ==
* The sound slightly lags. Bug produced with Fedora Core 2.
* If an enemy kills [[Tux]] and the user elects to abort the level before he falls off the screen, gameplay may continue with negative lives.
* When opening hand-edited levels/maps that have incorrect syntax, SuperTux crashes with an unmoveable mouse.
* SuperTux takes up more memory on each new level/game, until it crashes the systems. Using KDE System Guard suggests that finished maps/levels are not being freed from memory. Bug produced on a Knoppix/Debian system with 128MB of RAM.

== Development version ==
{{Attention|s=Please make sure to always specify an exact revision number with each bug report!}}
* free() errors when exiting SuperTux without having entered a worldmap/level.
** Results of [[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]]'s testing (references are of format ''file.ext:function:<code>code_line;</code>''):
*** Linux tends to scream while ''resources.cpp:unload_shared:<code>delete gold_text;</code>'' at ''video/texture.cpp:~Texture:<code>glDeleteTextures(1, &handle);</code>''
*** Mac screams while ''main.cpp:main:<code>delete script_manager;</code>'' at ''squirrel/squirrel/sqclosure.h:Release:<code>sq_delete(this,SQNativeClosure);</code>''
** Cannot reproduce. Are these still relevant?

* Mac OS X on Intel: dock icon looks wacky. This is an SDL problem; will submit a bug report ASAP.

* Revision 3641. Some platforms stop just above or below where it should. According to delta___ the bug should happen with pretty much any platform that moves fast enough and stops at an uneven part of it's speed.

* 3657: Infoboxes cause "Restarting audio source because of buffer underrun" errors

* 3657: Jamfile builds too long link command line, causing it to fail. Maybe disregarding the arch might help.

* 3771: Possible to die after winning a level if not invincible (happens in yeti level)
