This page is for listing all known bugs, because it seems that some have been escaping peoples' attention. Feel free to elaborate on any bugs already noted here, or comment on why it's not fixed if there's a reason for it. Also note if any of these have been fixed, of course.

== Website ==
* http://super-tux.sourceforge.net/ (subpages like http://super-tux.sourceforge.net/welcome.html ) exist, but should be deleted and redirected to http://supertux.berlios.de/
* Inoffical 0.1.3 installer for Windows is a deadlink

== Release 0.1.3 ==
* If an enemy kills tux and the user elects to abort the level before tux falls off the screen gameplay can continue with a negative life count.
* Wrong Texture type in texture.cpp (GL_RGB10_A2). Only fglrx (ati-drivers) will interpret it correct and will display waterfall not transparent in opengl mode. It is better to use GL_RGBA here since the most drivers (and mesa) interprets GL_RGB10_A2 as GL_RGBA (which is stupid....but it is so. so dont bother the drivers which does it correct)
* Doesn't seem to be in the Debian "testing" repository (which I'm using due to my Knoppix base)
:  I think Debian should get this bug and not the supertux team
:  Debian packages are ready and waiting to be uploaded, just wait a few more days
* After running configure without options and compilation of the source in supertux-0.1.3.tar, the supertux program crashes with "Error: Couldn't load musicfile", while it reports the filename with complete absolute path correctly (SALCON.MOD).  Slackware 9.1 system.

== Release 0.1.2 ==
* Sound lags a bit on my system (only Supertux has this problem, other games work fine - I'm using Fedora Core 2)
* If an enemy kills tux and the user elects to abort the level before tux falls off the screen gameplay can continue with a negative life count.
* When opening hand-edited levels or maps and these have incorrect syntax, Supertux crashes and the mouse is unmovable until re-login at X Window. (Maybe the ST 0.1.3/0.2 could "say", Invalid map.)
* On my Knoppix/Debian system, Supertux eats memory on each new level or game, until it crashes the system.  (I've only got 128M physical)  Watching the memory usage with KDE System Guard seems to suggest that finished maps/levels are not being freed.

== Development (svn) version ==

* Semi-predictable segfaults (happen when switching into/out of a level, or out of the map)
* Missing files (arctis2.jpg, mkinstalldirs)
* Plenty of graphical glitches (there's weird flickers whenever Tux is off the top of the screen, background goes nuts on some bonus levels)
* Tux does a tiny jump when he jumps while ducking (unprecedented and pointless behavior, has killed me more than once - why do we have it?)
** You try jumping while ducking :) - sik0fewl
*** It's not any more difficult than jumping three times my height (or smashing bricks with my head, for that matter). :P - NMcCoy
*Glibc seems to have a problem: <tt>*** glibc detected *** free(): invalid pointer: 0x082e22e8 ***</tt> (Fedora Core 3 fresh install with yum update) <br> GWater: Also seen bug on Fedora3 _64, have only seen crash on Yeti_Test screen so far. glibc detected double free or corruption: 0x0000003000e2da38 Aborted<br>This is not a glibc problem, but a problmen in our code that needs to be fixed.

*Sometimes killed with no reason. Just started a level and baam killed.
**Even tho you die, you don't lose a life.
***When are you killed and you started again sometimes time does not reset.
****These problems seem to be related to pausing and unpausing the game.  It appears that when you pause the game, on your next life (if you die) or on the next level, you will die due to a "times up!".  Haven't dug around the source code yet, but that's the correlation I see, at least on the win32 release. - blinkin

* (experienced in 0.1.3rc1, but please fix at least in trunk) When supertux crashes due to an assert() going false, it doesn't correctly restore the screen resolution and i'm left without a mouse pointer. man says that assert() calls abort() if false, and this sends a SIGABRT to our process. Please install a handler for SIGABRT which cleans up after ourselves (just in case there ever is another bug in supertux again *g*). - Philipp

*I get this error: Unexpected exception: Couldn't load file 'images/sprites.strf': Couldn't open file 'images/sprites.strf': No such file or directory with the svn version of 11-sept-05
