{{Navbox Milestone 2 Design Document}}
= Menu System =

Menu system of Milestone1 is rather ugly and could need a rewrite as well as a reorganization of some things:

* displaying the level name in/above/below the pause menu would be nice
* there should be an option to display the full GPL in the menu
* the menu system shall use icons to make it easier to find things even with no reading skills

== Profile ==

* Create new profile
* Delete profile
* Profile1 -> Main Menu
* Profile2 -> Main Menu
* ...

== Options == 

* Language
* Fullscreen: yes/no
* Aspect Ratio: 16/9, 16/10, 5/4, 4/3
* Sound Volume: off/0-100
* Music Volume: off/0-100
* Setup Keyboard:
* Setup Joystick:
* Use Profiles: yes/no

== Contrib Levels ==

* Check for new stuff online
* complete contrib worlds
* browse folders with level stuff

= Configuration =

The games configuration (fullscreen, aspect ratio, geometry, etc.) shouldn't be saved when supplied by command line.
