'''Ravu al Hemio''', known to the surroundings as '''Ondra Hosek''', is a hobby programmer. He is not very creative and his logical thinking is limited to consequential thinking, which is pretty useful in programming but totally useless in school maths, which frustrates him to excess. He wrote multiple patches for SuperTux after [[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]]'s '''Big Commit&trade;'''.

He is known by many as a whiner and pessimist, but he is trying to shut himself up as well and often as possible. He has not yet considered therapy for his lack of self-confidence, but it does seem to him as a sane alternative to any more drastic actions.

Currently, he is trying to get a position as a documentation writer and '''L''' bug fixer in the SuperTux project.
