'''Ravu al Hemio''', known to the surroundings as '''Ondra Hosek''', is a hobby programmer. He is not very creative and his logical thinking is limited to consequential thinking, which is pretty useful in programming but totally useless in school maths, which frustrates him to excess. He wrote multiple patches for SuperTux after [[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]]'s '''Big Commit&trade;'''. Once he manages to compile SuperTux using either Cygwin or MinGW, he will help out again. (He might install Linux later on.)
