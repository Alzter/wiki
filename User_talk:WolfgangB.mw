== Thank you for the second chance! ==

I really appreciate the second chance you gave me after I vandalized a bunch of pages. I know that I reverted myself before anyone noticed, but I didn't expect to be given a chance to contribute after that. Thanks :) [[Special:Contributions/50.80.139.102|50.80.139.102]] 23:57, 6 June 2011 (UTC)

== Could you link this to the main page? ==

Hello, I made a how to guide for supertux. Could you check it out, and put it at the main page? Thank you!

P.S it is not done yet.
