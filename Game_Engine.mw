The SuperTux game engine is structured as follows:

On startup, main.cpp instantiates a single MainLoop that is run until the application terminates.

The MainLoop manages, updates and draws all Screens, Controllers, Menus and the [[Console]]. A Screen is the abstract base class for code the MainLoop runs exclusively and full-screen.

Probably the most important Screen is the GameSession, which actually runs a Level. Examples of other Screens are: The SuperTux title screen, a world map or an intro text scroller.

A GameSession loads and runs a single Level, which consists of multiple, separate parts, the Sectors. Sectors contain the various GameObjects that can be encountered in SuperTux.

Examples of such GameObjects are the [[Badguys]], Players and TileMaps, but also Thunderstorm controllers, the currently visible viewport (i.e. a Camera object), the sector's time limit, etc.


More in-depth information about the game engine can be found in the source code itself, e.g. as [http://supertux.lethargik.org/development/doxygen/html/ Doxygen HTML Documentation], or on pages in [[:Category:Game Engine]], most notably:

* [[File formats]] and [[:Category:File Formats|File Formats]]
* [[Collision detection]]
* [[Tile]]
* [[Objects]]
