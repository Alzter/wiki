# SuperTux Forums, GitHub and IRC Rules

Before now there were no written rules. It was OK, but we now need to write the rules, because some people seem to think that there are no rules at all. Therefore:

Forum rules:

 - No spamming
 - No off-topic posts
 - No flaming. This is an open source project and not a flamewar.
 - Representing the development team is strictly forbidden, unless you are a member of the development team and the representation has been agreed upon.
 - Please try to search the web (and this wiki, for example) to see if you can find resources to fix a problem (e.g. with Git) before asking a member of the team. We are willing to help, but our time is precious, and we wish to develop, not troubleshoot.
 
GitHub rules:

 - (WIP)

IRC rules:

 - No spamming
 - Most conversations should be related to SuperTux
 - Try to avoid interrupting people
 - Never shout (by which we mean USING ALL CAPS)
 - Don't cause arguments
