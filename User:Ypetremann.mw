== Who I am ? ==

I'm a person that play supertux since it come on ubuntu.

== What did I expect from Supertux ? ==

I expect that supertux can be comparable of the SMB/NSMB on Nintendo DS, and that everybody can make easely a level for supertux, without having trouble.

== What I do for supertux ? ==

I make a level that have all tiles from one type, and make it more complete with new tiles.
== What can I do for supertux ? ==

I can help for making levels, debuging levels and make additional graphics.

I can help for find bug and suggestion.

And for now make supertux have more complete tileset for one type of tiles ( for example snow tiles)
