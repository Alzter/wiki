== Who I am ? ==

I'm a french person that play supertux since it come on ubuntu.
I'm very sorry for my english. It is not perfect, but I know it is not a good solution to speak french here

== What's my tools ? ==

The first tool I use is a graphic tablet on a Ubuntu computer.

First I use it on Inkscape to make a global mockup of that I want to make, after I use it and the picture on gimp for doing all that it can't do on inkscape.

Because I make website ( for now, just one is online and can be seen ), I use Geany for the programation part. 

== What did I expect from Supertux ? ==

I expect that supertux can be comparable of the SMB/NSMB on Nintendo DS, and that everybody can make easely a level for supertux, without having trouble.

== What I do for supertux ? ==

I make a level that have all tiles from one type, and make it more complete with new tiles.

== What can I do for supertux ? ==

I can help for making levels, debuging levels and make additional graphics.

I can help for find bug and suggestion.

And for now make supertux have more complete tileset for one type of tiles ( for example snow tiles)

== What other project I wan't they exist ? ==

Like SuperTux is a Mario's clone, I think that a clone of a 2D version of "The legend of Zelda" will come in a equivalent quality, and make it easy to create new level for this game.
