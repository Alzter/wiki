This is a list of issues, problems, ideas and stuff that Grumbel has about SuperTux.

Why is '''hitbox''' in .sprite called 'hitbox', when all I want is affect the offset/hotspot of the sprite and why should I supply a width/height parameters when I don't need them? hitbox and offset should really be two seperate concepts in a .sprite file.

Somebody should replace all that two-pixel large 'smoke/dust' with a proper dust sprite.

If stuff kills Tux it would actually be usefull if it looks deadly, which most stuff simply doesn't (I mean you spike tiles...).

Where is the consistency? Sometimes tiles are used for background, then they are used for the foreground or even interactive layer, its a mess.

== Features ==

New Milestone2 features that look usefull:

* wind, which can blow Tux around
* switches that can be used to trigger stuff
* unstable platforms, that break when Tux stands on them
* candles, that can go on and off, what are they good for?
* moving platforms, Tux can stand on them and get moved around
* Dart enemies, they attach to a wall and shoot arrows 
* auto scroll
* vertical/horizontal scroll
* stacking, not sure if that is actually usefull
* lightmapping
