This is a list of issues, problems, ideas and stuff that Grumbel has about SuperTux.

Why is '''hitbox''' in .sprite called 'hitbox', when all I want is affect the offset/hotspot of the sprite and why should I supply a width/height parameters when I don't need them? hitbox and offset should really be two seperate concepts in a .sprite file.

== Features ==

New Milestone2 features that look usefull:

* wind, which can blow Tux around
* switches that can be used to trigger stuff
* unstable platforms, that break when Tux stands on them
* candles, that can go on and off, what are they good for?
* moving platforms, Tux can stand on them and get moved around
* Dart enemies, they attach to a wall and shoot arrows 
* auto scroll
* vertical/horizontal scroll
* stacking, not sure if that is actually usefull
* lightmapping
