This is a list of issues, problems, ideas and stuff that Grumbel has about SuperTux.

Why is '''hitbox''' in .sprite called 'hitbox', when all I want is affect the offset/hotspot of the sprite and why should I supply a width/height parameters when I don't need them? hitbox and offset should really be two seperate concepts in a .sprite file.

Somebody should replace all that two-pixel large 'smoke/dust' with a proper dust sprite.

If stuff kills Tux it would actually be usefull if it looks deadly, which most stuff simply doesn't (I mean you spike tiles...).

Where is the consistency? Sometimes tiles are used for background, then they are used for the foreground or even interactive layer, its a mess.

Water... yeah, have a pinguin and then no ability to swim, not even collision with water, how stupid is that?

Trash, junk and other garbage and we call it 'levels'. The svn needs really some large cleanup to seperate the useless testing stuff from the usefull ones and the testing from the actually playable.

Reset point uglyness, they don't look good and not even like a reset point...

Difficulty, some of the current SuperTux levels that Ikaruga look like a game for kiddies... there really needs to be done *A LOT* to make SuperTux playable again. It would be nice to put a bit of fun back into SuperTux, currently its a frustrating mess.

Where are my L/R buttons? Autoscroll is ok, but a way to manipulate it manually would be really usefull.

The wingling coloring stinks (to much white), as does is behaviour, kamikaze dive is neither fun nor good looking

Forest tile repetition... if you want to go blind, looking at the forest tiles is a good way to acomplish that, somebody should either remove the repetition or redraw that mess completly.

Where is the dedicated run animation? Graphical hints are always a good thing.

Animation? None found. SuperTux, the game as a whole, not just the sprite, looks horrible, all static, with no fun animations around, boring.

Where are the tile-backgrounds? Huge bitmap graphics are soooo ugly..

Why have doors so small and Tux so fat? Tux just doesn't fit through a door by any means.

== Features ==

New Milestone2 features that look usefull:

* wind, which can blow Tux around
* switches that can be used to trigger stuff
* unstable platforms, that break when Tux stands on them
* candles, that can go on and off, what are they good for?
* moving platforms, Tux can stand on them and get moved around
* Dart enemies, they attach to a wall and shoot arrows 
* auto scroll
* vertical/horizontal scroll
* stacking, not sure if that is actually usefull
* lightmapping
