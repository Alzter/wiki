Tux
===
'''Tux the Penguin''' is the main character and protagonist of SuperTux. Tux's goal in SuperTux is to rescue his girlfriend Penny from the evil Nolok.

Tux has to chase down Nolok through different Worlds, but will have different [Actions](Actions) to help him in his rescue attempt.

Nolok
=====

Nolok is the enemy of [[Tux]], the antagonist of [[SuperTux]].
Just before Tux's picnic with his girlfriend [[Penny]], Nolok jumps out from behind a tree and captures Penny.
This event begins the [[Iceworld|events of the game]].

Penny
=====

We decided that Penny should be the name of [[Tux|Tux's]] girlfriend. Though Gown is slightly more popular (a couple of games use it), we found that it didn't sound very well.

Penny will be a playable character in Milestone 3.

== Concept art ==

The images below are sketches which are basic sketches of how Penny should be portrayed:

Fluffy
======

Fluffy is a penguin that never moulted from his original fluffy
feathers, so he looks like a baby penguin. He was teased by other
penguins and his only true friend is Tux. He can't run as fast as Tux,
but he can jump higher. He would be a second character which the
person playing the game could control instead of Tux.

* update instead of higher jump, double jump*
