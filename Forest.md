**The Forest** is the second world in SuperTux. 
This world is currently in the Contrib Levels menu, and has been in the game for a while now. 
It has yet to be added to the story, as it is not considered stable enough. 
It is currently one of the teams priorities for a future release.

### Badguys

There are a few forest specific enemies used in this world.

 - Zeeklings: These flying foes will bide their time and then suddenly swoop and dive-bomb you.
 - Walking Leaves: These enemies are much like snowballs in [Icy Island](Icy-Island), but have a camouflaged sprite to blend into the grass.
 - More exist, but are either considered unstable or are subject to change

### Levels

The forest world is still under development and therefore it is not reasonable to state which levels exist. Many will be removed or changed.

### End Boss

Currently, the end boss of this world is The Ghost Tree

== Forest ==

![Concept graphic for the Forest worldmap.](images/Worldmap2.png "fig:Concept graphic for the Forest worldmap.") The **Forest** is the second world in [SuperTux](SuperTux "wikilink"). It is generally a lively place with many creatures roaming about. Parts of the *Forest*, however, are spooked. This world was included in the unstable *SuperTux 0.3* releases but will be *removed* before [MMilestone 1.9](MMilestone_1.9 "wikilink"). It has been project to removed it, so status is uncertain. It will need attention before next release.

### Mini-Review 3

-   Revision tested at: 3927
-   Can be beat: yes
-   Difficulty: Slightly harder than “Nolok's Castle”
-   Rough edges: None that I noticed.
-   Time to beat: 01:45 (speedrun)

Praise:

-   Nice jumps (most of them).
-   Right mix of jumps/badguys/puzzel (mostly).
-   Good use of spikes (mostly).

Critique:

-   Jumping up and down on a moving platform to avoid the darts is too hard
-   A jump just after the the end of the first group of moving platforms are too hard (between those dark green things)
-   Sometimes a bit too many [Zeeklings](Zeekling "wikilink") at the same time.

### Mini-Review 4

-   Revision tested at: 3927
-   Can be beat: yes
-   Difficulty: Quite a bit harder than “Nolok's Castle”
-   Rough edges: Pass only as smalltux in some places.
-   Time to beat: 02:00 (speedrun)

Praise:

-   “Right” amount of badguys.
-   Good use of spikes (mostly).
-   Very fun bridge.
-   No extremely hard jumps.

Critique:

-   Near the end of the level there are some spikes, most of them are good but some are too hard as you can't pass them as bigtux.

christoph6.stl
--------------

Tux has to make his way through a wall and up in the clouds.

Status: playable (door size does no longer match, you have to jump to trigger end of level)

Difficulty:

  
  
easy/medium. Can be completed in &lt;2min.--[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 00:57, 7 Jul 2006 (BST)

detour.stl
----------

Tux has to climb some trees.

Difficulty:

  
One or two jumps are a bit tricky. --[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

Update r3937. Longer, more coin trails. --[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 03:13, 8 Jul 2006 (BST)

Update r4039: Two more signs right at the beginning to avoid the dead end. --[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 18:18, 17 Jul 2006 (BST)

dfk-level1.stl
--------------

Nolok has created a huge open space and drawn some lines through it.

Status: boring, empty, some new tiles shown, unbeatable, no defined goals

Difficulty: Easy, other than jumping up 100 times in a row

dfk-level2.stl
--------------

Nolok has erected his foundations, filled them with traps, and now Tux must navigate through them.

Status: Beatable, although the end (or at least, what appears to be the end) is missing

  
No badguys are in the level, so it feels very empty

Difficulty: Easy so far, but can only be beaten by taking a shortcut/secret path which requires backflips in some places.

  
Appears to be left unfinished, as the ordinary path is still unbeatable (Requires you to cross a large empty space filled with lava)

Uses switches to block/unblock passageways with column-like platforms, questionable usage at best. Extremely large and empty, distances between relevant objects could be shrunk. (Half the time spent in the level is walking back and forth) Spike pit is a bit large. One part requires Tux to jump off blindly, drop into a pit of lava, then lifts him out of the lava with platforms to allow Tux to continue - very disconcerting. The secret path is also odd, as it flips Tux, requires him to ride a platform across the level, passing over the parts he just went through, and then the flip-back area is too small and requires Tux to jump up to activate it. --[Mathnerd314](User#mathnerd314 "wikilink") 00:39, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

dfk-level3.stl
--------------

Having entered Nolok's castle at the bottom, Tux must now climb up to face him at the top. Status: Playable, although there are some *very* tight jumps in places (Take a running jump and stop on a two-tile platform, then do another running jump off that. Later, Tux gets to take a running jump up, go through a 1-tile gap between the ceiling and a bracket, and come back down 4 tiles later). Missing all its badguys. There are a few dead ends, but those are recoverable as Tux can fall back down.

Difficulty: Very hard, but only requires skilled handling of Tux and a working knowledge of the level. Adding badguys will make it either impossible or improbable to beat, depending on how they are placed. --[Mathnerd314](User#mathnerd314 "wikilink") 00:39, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

dfk-placeholder-1.stl
---------------------

Status: placeholder/test, since its displayed name is NOLOK it presumably represents an appearance of Nolok to laugh at Tux/criticize him.

Contains an Angrystone and very odd-looking tilesets as well which can only be accessed by ghosting through the floor. --[Mathnerd314](User#mathnerd314 "wikilink") 00:39, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

fish.stl
--------

Fishponds in the forest.

Difficulty:

  
My plan was to create a easy level. If you want all coins it's a bit more complicated. --[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

### Mini-Review 2

-   Can be beat: yes
-   Difficulty: about halfway through MS1
-   Rough edges: Tube doesn't cover Tux (won't fix without new tiles)
-   Time to beat: 0:22

Praise:

-   Introduces dispenser (fun!)

Critique:

-   Way too much bonus (165 coins are six extra lives and that's only from the coins)
-   Feels a bit short

--[Sommer](User#sommer "wikilink")

Update: extended in r3957. --[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 19:52, 8 Jul 2006 (BST)

Update r4038: Main level is one sector again. Less badguys, removed dispenser, made some jumps simpler. --[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 18:20, 17 Jul 2006 (BST)

owls\_revenge.stl
-----------------

Solvable. Easy. A bit short. Wasn't there a similar level on Giana?

  
IIRC sommer (I think it was sommer at least) said he made this level like some level in another game. --[AnMaster](User#anmaster "wikilink") 14:35, 4 Jul 2006 (BST)

trees.stl
---------

Forest, level starting on the right.

Difficulty:

  
IMO easy, but I got some training while making it. --[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

village.stl
-----------

A village in the light forest. Tux has to use a switch to solve the level. Use camera to give hint about switch and it's effect so it should not me too hard to figure out.

Difficulty:

  
I think it's medium but I played the level a lot while designing it. --[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 16:36, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

Somewhere between medium and easy I would say. --[AnMaster](User#anmaster "wikilink") 23:53, 6 Jul 2006 (BST)

### Mini-Review 1

-   Can be beat: yes
-   Difficulty: Slightly easier than “Nolok's Castle”
-   Rough edges: Tube doesn't cover Tux (won't fix without new tiles)
-   Time to beat: 1:01 (without waiting for platform)

Praise:

-   Straightforward
-   Introduces “color” hint signs

Critique:

-   Solid wood as a background tile is confusing
-   Having to wait for the platform is boring and complicates speedruns
-   Jump from roof to roof (without using invisible bonus blocks) is too hard. One shouldn't need the “bonus” blocks.

--[Sommer](User#sommer "wikilink")

Update: r3932 should fix most of the problems.--[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 21:04, 7 Jul 2006 (BST)

updown.stl
----------

Platforms. Background needs smaller tiles.

leaves.stl
----------

Forest Level. Easy standard level.

Crumbling\_Path
---------------

Forest Level with Unstable Tiles

builder.stl
-----------

'Tux the Builder'. A forest level with some rocks.

-   We might use this as an introductory level, but the first rock Tux encounters has to scream “carry me”. Users already had difficulty interpreting the “Run” sign in Milestone 1, level 1, so let's make this absolutely clear :-) --[Sommer](User#sommer "wikilink") 10:35, 30 Jul 2006 (BST)

  
  
I can add another rock near the start. If it's placed in midair it will drop down while the player is watching to make it clear that this rock is not a standard tile. If another sign next to the rock is not good enough we could mention it in the manual or add an infoblock. --[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 15:29, 30 Jul 2006 (BST)

Is something like <Media:RockHowTo-nq8.png> self explaining or does it need additional text? --[WolfgangB](User#wolfgangb "wikilink") 17:05, 31 Jul 2006 (BST)
