**The Forest** is the second world in SuperTux. 
This world is currently in the Contrib Levels menu, and has been in the game for a while now. 
It has yet to be added to the story, as it is not considered stable enough. 
It is currently one of the teams priorities for a future release.

### Badguys

There are a few forest specific enemies used in this world.

 - Zeeklings: These flying foes will bide their time and then suddenly swoop and dive-bomb you.
 - Walking Leaves: These enemies are much like snowballs in [Icy Island](Icy-Island), but have a camouflaged sprite to blend into the grass.
 - More exist, but are either considered unstable or are subject to change

### Levels

The forest world is still under development and therefore it is not reasonable to state which levels exist. Many will be removed or changed.

### End Boss

Currently, the end boss of this world is The Ghost Tree
