**The Forest** is the second world in SuperTux. 
This world is currently in the Contrib Levels menu, and has been in the game for a while now. 
It has yet to be added to the story, as it is not considered stable enough. 
It is currently one of the teams priorities for a future release.

### Badguys

There are a few forest specific enemies used in this world.

 - Zeeklings: These flying foes will bide their time and then suddenly swoop and dive-bomb you.
 - Walking Leaves: These enemies are much like snowballs in [Icy Island](Icy-Island), but have a camouflaged sprite to blend into the grass.
 - More exist, but are either considered unstable or are subject to change

### Levels

The forest world is still under development and therefore it is not reasonable to state which levels exist. Many will be removed or changed.

### End Boss

Currently, the end boss of this world is The Ghost Tree

![Concept graphic for the Forest worldmap.](Worldmap2.png "fig:Concept graphic for the Forest worldmap.") The **Forest** is the second world in [SuperTux](SuperTux "wikilink"). It is generally a lively place with many creatures roaming about. Parts of the *Forest*, however, are spooked. This world was included in the unstable *SuperTux 0.3* releases but will be *removed* before [MMilestone 1.9](MMilestone_1.9 "wikilink"). It has been project to removed it, so status is uncertain. It will need attention before next release.
