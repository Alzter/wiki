Hey! I'm jothesmo or Joth. I hate incorrect spelling/grammar and try my best to correct these errors.

I'm very active creating levels for SuperTux, though I haven't submitted any. Together, me and my friend have made together over 20 levels! But, 5 or 6 of them are pretty short. The newer ones are longer though. I never release any levels, because I'm paranoid and think that either my level sucks or someone will edit my work and redistribute it.
