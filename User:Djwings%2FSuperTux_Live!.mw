'''SuperTux Live!''' is an ongoing attempt to build a Linux-based Live CD to run SuperTux Milestone 1.9. At the moment, the base system is [http://www.myah.org Myah OS], a small, remasterable Live CD based on SLAX, but without the Glibc issues and much faster. It will be optimized for a Pentium II or later (i686), and for size, at the build level, making it obscenely fast. Previously, the base system was [http://www.sam-linux.org/ SAM Linux], a [http://www.pclinuxos.com PCLinuxOS]-based distribution that uses [http://www.xfce.org XFCE] as its default desktop for high performance and decent aesthetics. That was scrapped because 430MB for a game demo is by far too much. The original base was [http://www.slax.org SLAX Linux], an excellent Live CD with tools to mold it to the user's whims, but this was abandoned permanently due to conflicts between the versions of Glibc used to compile SLAX and SuperTux.
Beta 3 is available for download, testing, and <s>whining</s>feedback.
