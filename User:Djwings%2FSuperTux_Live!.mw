'''SuperTux Live!''' is an attempt to build a Linux-based Live CD to run SuperTux Milestone 1.9. At the moment, the base system is [http://www.gentoo.org Gentoo Linux], a source-based distribution with no additional features, that can be molded to suit the user's needs. It will be optimized for a Pentium II or later (i686), and for size, at the build level, making it obscenely fast. Previously, the base system was [http://www.sam-linux.org/ SAM Linux], a [http://www.pclinuxos.com PCLinuxOS]-based distribution that uses [http://www.xfce.org XFCE] as its default desktop for high performance and decent aesthetics. The original base was [http://www.slax.org SLAX Linux], an excellent Live CD with tools to mold it to the user's whims, but this was abandoned permanently due to conflicts between the versions of Glibc used to compile SLAX and SuperTux.

== What the system will include ==
-SuperTux Milestone 1.9<br />
-Enlightenment Desktop Environment<br />
-Linux kernel 2.6.20<br />
-Open-source NVidia (and ATI?) drivers for graphics acceleration<br />
-Binary-level optimizations for speed and size<br />
