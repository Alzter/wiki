This page is dedicated to tracking the status of the [[SuperTux Live!]] CD.

==April 2== 
Base system installed, wiki page created. :) Some customizations (wallpaper, app selection, FireFox bookmarks) finished, PhysFS added (I happened to have a SLAX module lying around).<br />
==April 3== 
Planned date to add SuperTux/OpenAL/Fedora icon theme. Also setting up Exaile's default playlist to play the list of theme songs and removing Compiz and Beryl ( :( ). Finally, I discovered a flaw in PhysFS: I installed version 1.1, whereas SuperTux uses 1.0. :o Ah well, nothing good ol' "ln -s" can't solve.<br />
Update: SuperTux has been installed, with a somewhat scary footnote: I test-ran it on my laptop and got astoundingly good framerates. This should be normal, but my laptop doesn't have 3D acceleration. :o PhysFS had to be reinstalled before Autopackage would install SuperTux. In the final version, launching Exaile (the media player, similar to amaroK) will load the entire musical score from the game. Finally, the first ISO image has ben created- and it's less than 440MB! It will fit onto a CD-RW with ease, and will download quickly.<br />
Another update: Alpha 1 created (public releases start at Beta 2), and guess what? SuperTux works. ;) One problem: SAM Linux uses the open-source NV drivers that come with X and are annoyingly slow. My desktop computer, with its GeForce 5200, isn't ''quite'' a test system. This might just be a problem with me, but we'll find out when public testing starts. For Beta 1, I'll try to work on the branding: a custom icon theme and splash art are in the works. Not to mention a nifty save/restore feature if you have a USB drive... Thanks go out to the SAM Linux and PCLinuxOS development teams! ;)<br />
==April 7== 
I've been slacking off... But don't worry, all I need to do now is make sure the new icon theme and save/restore system work. I've installed Zenity, written the scripts, swiped the RPMs from the Fedora repositories... ;) STL! will use Fedora's new Echo icon theme, which looks cool, but is better suited to STL! than Fedora, in my opinion (but only because the existing "Bluecurve" icon theme is as awesome as ever). On a related note, a shoutout to Anja, whose "Coconut Fortress" and "In the Spring" levels will be used in SuperTux Live!.<br>
==April 8== 
The scripts work, as does the new icon theme (flawlessly). I didn't test "In the Spring", but "Coconut Fortress" works fine. I'll rebuild the image as soon as possible. For the second beta (public release! :), I'll need to go commando on any non-GPL software that I don't need for SuperTux to work (MP3 codecs, for instance), add some bonus tracks (spoiler warning! ;), and ''find a hoster!'' Where can someone host a 500-megabyte chunk of mostly-free software for free? 5 days to do so...<br>
Update: Thanks go out to Joseph Brower, who has offered to host the CD image! :) To make the job slightly easier for him, the file is now about 400 MB, thanks to some major pruning (printer drivers? For what?). The first beta is now on my hard drive in ISO format. Again, this is an internal release. Five days to polish the UI some more and test like mad, then Beta 2 hits the Web for download. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]]: N0 PH33R 00:37, 9 April 2007 (UTC)<br>
