== Introduction ==

If you want to build the current development version on Windows, these step-by-step instructions are for you.

== Warnings ==

Before you proceed, however, carefully read the following warnings:

* You will be building a highly unstable development version of SuperTux. This might cause permanent damage to your system, your brain or both!
* Do not try these instructions out on a production system. Use a virtual machine (e.g. VMWare or [http://www.virtualbox.org/ VirtualBox]) instead.
* Most developers currently focus on getting SuperTux stable for Linux. Feel free to try getting it to work on Windows, but do not expect much support down this road.
* Read these instructions to the end before starting your install. If any step makes you feel unsure, better wait for a Windows release of SuperTux.
* The whole build process takes about one hour to complete, depending on your internet connection and processor power. Why not do something more productive in that hour? Maybe do some housework?
* The build process fails on Windows Vista sometimes. (please open a bug in our [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/ bug tracker] to help us figure out why)

== FastBuild with Visual Studio ==

''This is experimental''
Tested on W7/VS2010 x64

Steps:

* Install Visual Studio
* Download CMake 2.8+
* Open cmake gui
* Set dirs according to your Environment (p.ex.: H:\STuxSVN and H:\STuxSVN\bin)
* Press Configure, select your version of VS (with native compilers) and click on finish
* Now CMake tells you what to do. If asked for any libs, make sure to download and add them to your environment strings

Small List of DLs:
* Boost: BOOST_ROOT: H:\STuxSVN\boost_1_42_0 / BOOST_LIBRARYDIR: $BOOST_ROOT\libs)
* OpenAL: OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR: D:\Program Files (x86)\OpenAL 1.1 SDK\include
* Ogg Vorbis: VORBIS_INCLUDE_DIR: H:\STuxSVN\libvorbis-1.2.3
* SDLIMAGE: SDLIMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR: H:\STuxSVN\SDL_image-1.2.10\include
* SDL: SDL_INCLUDE_DIR: H:\STuxSVN\SDL-1.2.14

== Preparation ==

OK, enough of that. Here are the exact steps for building SuperTux on a fresh Windows installation:

* Create or pick a working folder. Its path should not contain any spaces. (The root of a drive, such as C:\ or D:\, is fine)
** I chose D:\Build_SuperTux; change the commands to match your choice.
** Every non-absolute path I give is relative to this directory

=== Checking Things Out ===

* We want to check out the latest sources from SVN
* Pick a [http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#binary-packages Subversion client]: (instructions vary depending on client)
*# CollabNet binaries require a login, but are very similar to the next option
*#* I chose [http://www.collab.net/servlets/OCNDirector?id=CSVN1.6.6WINS]
*# [http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=8100 Apache 2.2 Binaries]
*#* I chose [http://subversion.tigris.org/files/documents/15/46144/svn-win32-1.6.6.zip svn-win32-1.6.6.zip]
*#* Unpack the binaries to svn
*#* Add subversion to your path
*#** Right click "My Computer" and go to Properties->Advanced->Environment Variables.
*#** Edit or add the PATH variable in either window.
*#** Add a semicolon at the end if not present and type D:\Build_SuperTux\svn\bin at the end.
*#* Open a command prompt (Start->Run and type cmd) and type svn checkout http://supertux.lethargik.org/svn/supertux/trunk/supertux D:\Build_SuperTux\supertux
*# [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] has a nice GUI - try [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/tortoisesvn/TortoiseSVN-1.6.6.17493-win32-svn-1.6.6.msi?download TortoiseSVN-1.6.6.17493-win32-svn-1.6.6.msi]
*#* You must install and reboot to finish the installation (SVN-Options will appear in the right-click menu in the Explorer)
*#* right-click this folder and select "SVN checkout..." from the context menu
*#* As repository URL, enter: http://supertux.lethargik.org/svn/supertux/trunk/supertux
*#* As checkout dir, enter: D:\Build_SuperTux\supertux

* begin your checkout and wait - this might take some time, so to the next step...
