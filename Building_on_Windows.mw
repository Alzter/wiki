== Introduction ==

If you want to build the current development version on Windows, these step-by-step instructions are for you.

== Warnings ==

Before you proceed, however, carefully read the following warnings:

* You will be building a highly unstable development version of SuperTux. This might cause permanent damage to your system, your brain or both!
* Do not try these instructions out on a production system. Use a virtual machine (e.g. VMWare or [http://www.virtualbox.org/ VirtualBox]) instead.
* Most developers currently focus on getting SuperTux stable for Linux. Feel free to try getting it to work on Windows, but do not expect much support down this road.
* Read these instructions to the end before starting your install. If any step makes you feel unsure, better wait for a Windows release of SuperTux.
* The whole build process takes about one hour to complete, depending on your internet connection and processor power. Why not do something more productive in that hour? Maybe do some housework?
* The build process fails on Windows Vista sometimes. (please open a bug in our [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/ bug tracker] to help us figure out why)

== Preparation ==

OK, enough of that. Here are the exact steps for building SuperTux on a fresh Windows installation:

* Create or pick a working folder. Its path should not contain any spaces. (The root of a drive, such as C:\ or D:\, is fine)
** I chose D:\Build_SuperTux; change the commands to match your choice.
** Every non-absolute path I give is relative to this directory

=== Checking Things Out ===

* We want to check out the latest sources from SVN
* Pick a [http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#binary-packages Subversion client]: (instructions vary depending on client)
*# CollabNet binaries require a login, but are very similar to the next option
*#* I chose [http://www.collab.net/servlets/OCNDirector?id=CSVN1.6.2WINS]
*# [http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=8100 Apache 2.2 Binaries]
*#* I chose [http://subversion.tigris.org/files/documents/15/46144/svn-win32-1.6.3.zip svn-win32-1.6.3.zip]
*#* Unpack the binaries
*#* Add subversion to your path
*#** Right click "My Computer" and go to Properties->Advanced->Environment Variables.
*#** Edit or add the PATH variable in either window.
*#** Add a semicolon at the end if not present and type D:\Build_SuperTux\svn\bin at the end.
*#* Open a command prompt (Start->Run and type cmd) and type svn checkout http://supertux.lethargik.org/svn/supertux/trunk/supertux D:\Build_SuperTux\supertux
*# [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] has a nice GUI - try [http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tortoisesvn/TortoiseSVN-1.3.1.5521-svn-1.3.0.msi?download TortoiseSVN-1.3.1.5521-svn-1.3.0]
*#* You must install and reboot to finish the installation (SVN-Options will appear in the right-click menu in the Explorer)
*#* right-click this folder and select "SVN checkout..." from the context menu
*#* As repository URL, enter: http://supertux.lethargik.org/svn/supertux/trunk/supertux
*#* As checkout dir, enter: D:\Build_SuperTux\supertux

* begin your checkout and wait - this might take some time, so to the next step...

=== Getting Busy ===
* Run the 7-zip and OpenAL SDK installers. (OpenAL requires administrative privileges)
* Select all the archives from the MinGW project, right click, and select "Extract here". Repeat with the generated *.tar files. Answer "no to all" if prompted to overwrite.
* Move usr\local to local if it exists, otherwise create local
* Extract into local from all the remaining packages the folders bin, lib, include, and share such that the folders are local\bin, local\lib, local\include, and so on. Ignore any overwrite prompts (the files that are being overwritten don't matter)
* Copy dll's from local\lib into local\bin, saying "no" to overwrite
* Go to C:\Program Files\OpenAL 1.1 SDK
* Copy the include directory there to local
* Copy \samples\playoggvorbis\include\* to local\include\*
* Copy the Ogg and Vorbis DLL's to local\bin
* Launch MSYS with msys.bat
** Tip: If you don't want to type in everything manually, copy it using the normal keys of your browser (Ctrl-C) and paste into MSYS by clicking on the icon in the title bar and selecting Edit->Paste to paste in.

== Building ==

* PhysFS 2.0.0 needs a patch to make it compile without warnings under Windows. Change
 IF(PHYSFS_IS_GCC4)
   ADD_DEFINITIONS(-fvisibility=hidden)
 ENDIF(PHYSFS_IS_GCC4)
to
 IF(PHYSFS_IS_GCC4 AND NOT WINDOWS)
   ADD_DEFINITIONS(-fvisibility=hidden)
 ENDIF(PHYSFS_IS_GCC4 AND NOT WINDOWS)
in local/phyfs-2.0.0/CMakeLists.txt
* We're ready to build PhysFS. Type in the following:
 cd /local/physfs*
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/local
 make
 make install
* We're ready to build SuperTux.
* Change to the SuperTux checkout directory
 cd /supertux
* Copy useful databases from /local/lib and /bin (or from a copy of SuperTux 0.3.1) - not all are needed, try moving the databases elsewhere and moving them back one at a time to reduce them.
 cp /local/bin/*.dll .
 cp /bin/libgcc_*.dll .
 
* Make a build directory to store generated files
 mkdir build
 cd build
* Start the actual build (everything else was libraries)
 INCLUDE="/local/include/SDL" cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DDEBUG=ON ..
 make
* Optional: if those "missing sound" messages annoy you, and you don't care about [[DataFiles|licensing issues]], run
 cd ../data/sounds
 svn update -r5392 bump-upgrade.wav iceblock_bump.wav kick.wav squish.wav stomp.wav
* Now run supertux2.exe, sit back, and enjoy the game.

== Building the editor ==

There's a new gtk-sharp based editor in development which can also be built on windows. To do so you first have to get and install the following dependencies:
=== Dependencies ===
* Make sure you have OpenGL drivers installed
* Microsoft .NET 1.X framework SDK, you should be able to get this here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b3a2ca6-3647-4070-9f41-a333c6b9181d&DisplayLang=en
* Microsoft .NET 2.X framework SDK, yes you need 1.x AND 2.x at the moment!: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=FE6F2099-B7B4-4F47-A244-C96D69C35DEC&displaylang=en
* Gtk-Sharp 2.7 SDK for windows, make sure you actually get the SDK the runtime version contains some bugs that affect the editor: http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfcontent/private.php/gtks-inst4win/Win32%20Installer/v2.7.1/gtksharp-2.7.1-win32-0.5.exe
* Microsoft Visual C# Express Edition, it's a free version of visual studio and we use it for compiling (and development on win32): http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualcsharp/download
*:This apparently requires SP2 on Windows XP. (not tested on any other Windows versions)
*::Is anybody still using XP without SP2? It that machine hast net connection its a bad idea.
* SDL.dll and SDL_image.dll, you can get these from an existing SuperTux installation or from the downloads above.

=== Building ===

* Get the sourcecode from [[Download/Subversion|svn]]
* Open supertux-sharp.sln by double clicking on it (it should open in Visual C# Express now).
* Build the project in debug and release mode (use F6 and then F5 for example)
* Copy SDL.dll and SDL_image.dll into the bin\Debug and bin\Release directory that has just been created
* You can now go back to Visual Studio Express and start the editor with F11. Note that the debug mode is quite slow for the OpenGL calls, so if you actually want to use the editor instead of developing it start it in release mode (CTRL+F11)

You might want to read the [[Editor FAQ]] at this point.
