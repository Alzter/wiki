== QA checks == 
Currently we have a function to check for invalid tile IDs in the level, although it is useful it could be extended to more things.
Some examples are:
* Check that there is a sector called "main" that contains a spawnpoint called "main" as well.
* Check that there is at least one spawn point in each sector and that something calls it.
* Check for other common issues (mainly issues that can happen in converted levels from 0.1.x and issues due to changes in the game/editor to find and fix all affected levels and such)
* Check for "bad" tile combinations, for example: if we have a grass top tile the tile below it should be a specific one, note that we must check in all tilemaps for this. 
* Batch checking all levels in a directory (command line?)
