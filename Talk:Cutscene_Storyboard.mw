I think the end for antarctica should show the yeti pulling out a big club and whacking him to the next world -F50
:That doesn't make a lot of sense after Tux was victorous over him...
:: Tux doesn't have to defeat the yeti, just hurt him a couple of times. See [[Talk:Yeti]] for the original propostion of the idea -F50
::: I still think this is stupid. Tux should defeat the Yeti and move on (although I'm still not sure how exactly). And why should we make a reference to a dumb flash game? -Wansti
Perhaps the player can choose between using Tux or Penny for milestone 3. Also why does Penny go to this world instead of anywhere else and does Tux follow somehow?
: That is to be explained after milestone 2; according to these story ideas, the forest world gets an open end with Tux beating the boss and Penny escaping, both unaware of each other's presence. -Wansti
I like the idea of the yeti teaching Tux the butt-jump. For flapping Tux could fall off a cliff on his way to the forest and learn by necessity. -F50
