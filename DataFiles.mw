According to credits.txt some of our sounds are from "Royalty free sound effects CDROMs and FTP sites" which is too unspecific.
This page is used to find out who made which file and which files have to be replaced to get rid of unspecific 3rd party files.

Files which are unspecific have been '''removed''' from SVN.
