'''Krush''' and '''Krosh''' are [[badguy]]s found in [[Icy Island]]. They are usually found on ceilings. If Tux comes underneath one, it suddenly drops without warning. If Tux does not get out of the way fast, he is hurt. After they hit the ground, they slowly drift back up. On this "return trip," Tux may safely climb on top of them and hitch a ride.

Both "icecrushers" are available in [[SVN]].
