A '''badguy''' in ''SuperTux'' is a foe of [[Tux]]. They may not be "bad" in the way that a hedgehog isn't really bad, but they can certainly hurt Tux. Most of the badguys are creatures, like [[Snowball]]s with varying characteristics, but some are more like objects ([[Stalactite]] for example) or phenomena like [[Flame]].

Tux will try to avoid approaching badguys if possible. If he runs into one or one drops on his head, he is hurt. When hurt Tux will lose a [[powerup]] or, if Tux has no powerups left, will be pushed off the screen.

Many of the badguys Tux can knock out by jumping on them and squishing them. Others are only stunned by this for a short while or are insusceptible to this and hurt Tux instead. As a rule of thumb, badguys with a spiky head or helmet can usually not be jumped on. For a list of badguys that can be squished take a look at the [[:Category:Squishable badguys|squishable badguys category]].
