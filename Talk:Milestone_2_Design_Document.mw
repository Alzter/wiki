== Single-sprite Tux ==

The single-sprite may look better normally, but in my opinion, the split sprite is more expressive. You can see Tux's arms still carrying stuff while he's ducking, for example. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 00:01, 6 May 2008 (UTC)

== Options are evil ==

You expect the level designer to test them with several screensize and the size of the projected area? Get realistic, I'm glad I find time to create levels at all. 2560x1600? Did you win the jackpot? Keep 800x600 the recommended and tested size where every level has to work. Otherwise we get some levels optimized for one setting and other levels for another one.
:Basically everything is resolution-independent now. Try searching for SCREEN_WIDTH or SCREEN_HEIGHT in the source code - it's all effects and removing off-screen particles. The main thing, when I tested it, was that you have to add a few more bottom and top tiles to the levels so that they fill up the entire screen instead of leaving black bars at the top/bottom. Of course, since all Milestone2 levels are supposed to have some verticalness, that shouldn't be a problem.
:Oh, it's also necessary to completely hide secret areas so users don't get a peek and an unfair advantage. (But hey, they paid for their large screens for a reason...) Don't forget, you're free to make whatever levels you want. It's just that only levels following the guidelines will be accepted. I'd be happy to make levels if you don't.
