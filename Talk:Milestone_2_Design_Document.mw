== Single-sprite Tux ==

The single-sprite may look better normally, but in my opinion, the split sprite is more expressive. You can see Tux's arms still carrying stuff while he's ducking, for example. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 00:01, 6 May 2008 (UTC)

== Options are evil ==

You expect the level designer to test them with several screensize and the size of the projected area? Get realistic, I'm glad I find time to create levels at all. 2560x1600? Did you win the jackpot? Keep 800x600 the recommended and tested size where every level has to work. Otherwise we get some levels optimized for one setting and other levels for another one.
