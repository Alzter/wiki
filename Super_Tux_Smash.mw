{{delete}} Some [[User ideas]] about a completely different game.

=Super Tux Smash=

Super Tux Smash would be a mod of the Super Tux Engine for Multiplayer,
loosely based on Super Smash Brothers Melee but with some completely different gameplay.

== Features needed in the engine ==

Multiplayer support (having more than one controllable player, eventually maybe network support?)

Colorization of players (so that players could have a red vs blue penguin battle), or a variety of playable characters.

All-way scrolling. (Already in Milestone 2)

Destructible blocks by fireballs. (Already in Milestone 2) 

Intro, Winners podium extro.

Unlimited lives.

Mini-viewport (ala Smash Bros) to show where players have gone offscreen

== Game Modes ==

Eventual network play team info included.

Deathmatch - Knock the other player(s) off the platforms. Whoever has the least falls wins when time is up.
Free for all.

Coin Collect - Collect as many coins as possible while avoiding/harrasing the other player(s).
Whoever has the most coins wins when time is up. <4 teams, multiple players or free for all.

Capture the Flag - Get the flag of the other player(s)/team(s) to your flag. Whoever has the most touches
wins when time is up. <4 teams, multiple players.

Zone Control - Touch platforms to "paint" them. Whoever has the most platforms of their color wins when
time is up. <4 teams, multiple players.

Soccer - Use a Bouncy Snowball as a soccer ball and have goals at either side of the (closed) level. Still have
platforms and powerups. Whoever has the most goals wins when time is up. 2 teams, multiple players

== Powerups ==

Instead of having Question Blocks, have balloons which occasionally float up from the bottom of the screen.
Powerups include:

Grow - break thru platforms from side or bottom when grown. Also less vulnerable to jump attack.

Fire flower - instant death (respawn) to opponent when hit, break platforms.

Ice flower - freeze opponent for 5 seconds.

Umbrella - float farther, slower.

Rocket pack - WASD movement for 15 seconds, fireflower ability.

Balloon - some balloons would be empty but allow you to float. All balloons would pop when hitting a platform
or player. There might also be tied balloons which don't pop but you have to jump across fast due to jiggling.

Magnet - allows you to grab onto the bottom of platforms and move along them.

Spiky shell - invulnerability for 30 seconds

== Characters ==

Tux

Penny

Other penguins (colorized, EvilPenguin, Albino, Magellenic, Macaroni)

Nolok

Snowball (Bouncing/Walking/Spiky combination)

Walking Flame

MrBomb

MrIceBlock

Polar Bear

Seal

Yeti

Poison Ivy

Spider

MrTree

MrTotem

Zeekling

Ghost

Dillo

Mozilla

Sushi

Skirpy

Beastie (BSD logo)

Platypus (Hexley, Darwin logo)

== Attacks ==

Peck - run up to opponents to peck them - this can knock them off the platform.

Jump attack - instant death to non-grown opponents.

Spin attack - instant death to all opponents.

Powerups - above.

Specials - per character.

== Design Issues ==

Need vertical, multi platform based levels.

Physics-based platforms (ala Gish) would be nice.

Underwater levels would be nice.

Seesaws and Trampolines could be important.

Could use some enemies like the jumpy spiky, fish etc.

Would be nice to have some new ones like:

Anvils (drop from the sky once in a while, break platforms)

Arrows, Rockets, or Chompers (come from the sides if you get too close to edges)

Rockets could also launch from the bottom once in a while.

For big (scrolling) levels, teleports (w/ directional arrows and random ones) and/or a minimap would be nice.

Bottoms of levels should be water, lava, spikes, or void.

* Sounds great, can't wait. Just ''please'' keep hexley out of it. --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 00:24, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

*STORY IDEAS! MY idea is we could have CPU characters (with AI! WOOT!) and have two single-player modes. Classic (a map of a colloseum with every other character in a straight line) and an Adventure mode (like only as big as one supertux world.) The story for adventure is Tux and Penny were on a walk when meanwhile, Nolok is hiding underground. EvilTux knocks on his door and Nolok opens it. EvilTux says he wants to help Nolok destroy Tux. Then EvilTux shows up with Tux and Penny. You can change between Tux and Penny between levels. Anyway, Tux goes through 1 antarctica level. Boss is EvilTux (an easy version). Then EvilTux goes back to Nolok. Nolok puts him in a cloning machine. The next level is Forest level. You fight EvilTux clones at every quarter of the level. Then EvilTux is really destroyed. Meanwhile Nolok puts forest DNA in the Yeti. Next level is Tropical Island. Boss is Sasquatch. Finally, Tux gets back to Antarctica and Nolok appears to fight, but Gown (yes I'm including her for some reason) jumps on Nolok's head (similar to Sonic jumping on Tabuu from smash bros.) Then Nolok zaps Gown. You fight Gown hypnotized. Then Nolok pulls you all into a portal. You fight several bosses. 

#Yeti
#Mr. Totem
#Haunted Tree
#Sasquatch (harder)
#EvilTux (harder)
#Warty Hand (giant nolok hand)
#Nolok with wings and magic (FINAL BOSS)

Then the portal spits Tux Penny and Gown out onto the ground. Credits roll.

* IDEA: special moves you can learn at dojos. A_key is arrow key. Advantage defines a little bonus to player "advantaged" in the stage. PoWER is abbreviated for "Pwnage of Weird Enemies Robotechnics"(EvilTux's Helmetron made by PoWER)
LOCATIONS:
Icyisland (advantage to Tux),
The Forest,
Penguinos Island (advantge to Pingu, how to unlock: Destroy Tux statue at Icyisland and jump into secret passage under it),
Antarctica Meltdown (unlock all special moves)[
Boss:Fry, a fireball with eyes.
Intro boss cutscene: Player jumps onto a half-sunk stone platform. Fry appears. "This place is only for one!" PLAYER:"And this "one" is me!"(puts on ice cap)
CONTROLS CHANGE: |1| is to shoot iceball.
Phase 1.
Flying around Fry is equipped with wand shooting fire and with sphrere-shaped shield. To hurt him, shoot his wand with iceball.
Phase 2. 
Fry loses his stuff and starts to jump. If he lands near player, player gets hurt. Shoot him with iceball.
Phase 3.
Fry splits to some amount of little fireballs, acting like Fry in Phase 2. Shoot them all with iceballs.]
Nolok's Castle (Advantage to Nolok and Eviltux (from supertuxkart))[
Boss:Nolok]
Grand Finale (accessible only with Tux)[
Boss: Eviltux]
