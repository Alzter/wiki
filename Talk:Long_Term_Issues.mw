== What Tux should look like with Fire Flower ==

: Of the options presented here, I like the fireman's hat the best.  It would be cool to have different objects trigger different types of throwables, similar to the early MegaMan games. Some ideas: a limited number of "swarm" throwables that would scatter and kill anything in their path. A bomb that goes for a certain distance then explodes. Have the snowball freeze, but not kill, a bad guy. A "guided fish missile" that would home in on an enemy no matter where they are.  --[[User:Mbsmith|Mbsmith]] 11:11, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

== Life and Death ==

'''Question:''' Why does Tux lose Fire Flower capability when jumping from the crouch position? I like the idea of special jumps costing coins - but losing fireflower is a tough one. --[[User:Mbsmith|Mbsmith]] 11:28, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

== Run or Walk? ==

: Coming from other games and MS1, I think it makes sense to have Tux run when the Action key is pressed. I might be missing something, but I have not found a level where I need to slow down in order to get past an obstacle. Automatically running after a certain number of steps / time works as well, but it adds a bit of an extra challenge to push the key to run --[[User:Mbsmith|Mbsmith]] 11:11, 14 June 2007 (UTC)


== Up and Jump (resolved) ==


: Clearly. This has been a major pet peeve for a while. By the way, how has this been "resolved"? Is there a fix in the nightly? --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]]: N0 PH33R 11:19, 14 June 2007 (UTC)
