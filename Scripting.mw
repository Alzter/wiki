We discussed the possibilities of scripting in the [[Meeting log (2005-04-02)|meeting]]. Some points we came up with:

* Keep it simple! Do complicated stuff in c++
* Only use it for simple stuff at first (cutscenes, triggers), so that we can keep the API small that gets exported to the scripts
* No scripting for badguys (needs too much classes exported probably, maybe we can weaken the rule a bit for some types of badguys)
* We might look at the [http://squirrel.sourceforge.net/ squirrel] language for scripting
