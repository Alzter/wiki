If you have created your own levels, and wish to release them, then you can place a link here. Alternately, follow the guide at [[Contributing]] if you want them to be in the main game.

== Icy Island ==

The following levels are currently part of [[Icy Island]].
{{Level list Icy Island}}

== Incubator Island ==
: ''→ See also: [[Incubator Island]]''

In the [[SVN]] version, there is a special island, [[Incubator Island]]. In this world are brand new levels that we plan to include in the main level set once they are "ready", i.e. well tested and fun to play. You can actually help us by playing those levels and giving us feedback about them.

== Third-party levels ==

=== Add-ons ===
: ''→ See also: [[Add-ons]]''

The development version has the ability to automatically download some specially packaged levels, known as "[[add-ons]]". Simply ensure you have an internet connection, and select "Addons" from the main menu, where you can choose to install the currently available add-ons.

===Manually Installed Add-ons===

Additional [[Add-ons]] can be installed manually.  You can either obtain them from an external source or make your own.  You will need to perform the following steps to play these add-ons:

* Install either the development snapshot (0.3.3) or the GIT version of SuperTux
* Download the desired add-on which should be "zipped" - there is no need to extract them...
* Instead, place the .zip file downloaded into your supertux2 directory (alternatively if you are using a GIT version you may place the .zip file directly into the data directory)
* Start SuperTux and choose "Contrib Levels" on the main menu, the add-on should be listed here

External add-ons may suffer from more bugs than those automatically downloaded through the game client.  They also may not conform to the level design criteria and difficulty requirements for SuperTux.  If an external add-on fails to work properly, try to contact the developer of the add-on directly.  

====Add-on Collection for 0.3.3 and 0.3.3-SVN/GIT====

{{Attention|s=As of January 2013 the addons accessible in-game have been moved to google code.  This means that this addon collection is no longer needed for recent versions of GIT and will no longer be maintained.  However, the addons will remain accessible for older versions of SuperTux.}}

Several add-ons are available for manual installation from an external download site [http://www.mediafire.com/?k47v61nz6i230 here].  These levels have been collected by [[User:LMH|lmh]].  Most of these are available on the bugtracker  This collection is meant to make add-ons more widely available and consists of unofficial add-ons created by a variety of authors.  To reduce the clutter on the bugtracker, a [http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=69 forum] has been set up to discuss issues with the individual add-ons.  The table below outlines the current content of the level collection including the last time the add-on was updated in the collection:
