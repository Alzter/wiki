# Project management
#* (Unstable) Release
#** Yes or no? – What features? When?
#*** Do we remove the [[Forest]] world or rather implement the ''ghost forest'' tiles/levels/badguys…
#*** Remove [[:Category:Badguy.3|milestone 3 badguys]] so they stop cluttering up source tree? (would make [[World 2]] unplayable) 
#* Google Code move
#** Work in progress
#** Repository is synced up to latest version by [[User:Grumbel|grumbel]]
#** SVN dumps are different for some reason (format change?)
#** Still left: binary downloads, 0.3.1, bug tracker, wiki, etc. (decide which we want)
#* Semi-anonymous contributions (email/nick but no real name)
#* Bug tracker workflow
#** Still some bugs with patches floating around (either commit them or close as won't fix)
#** Feedback is for requesting feedback or for stating that feedback has been given?
# Gameplay
#* Carrying objects
#** [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/6794925041b61bdc5a941a5640914188-supertux-carry.png Proposed behavior]
#** Small Tux should not be able to go through 1-tile tall tunnels when carrying stuff
#*** Requires extending the hitbox
#** Should held items function as a shield? (They do in SMW3)
#** Prority? (I.e.: Should this go into the next release or is this something that can wait?)
# Source code
#* SCons
#** Keep or remove completely? (unsupported, debug build only)
#* Move external libraries out of tree and require them on the system itself (distro support?)
#** tinygettext: [http://ohnopub.net/~ohnobinki/tmp/supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-required.patch supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-required.patch] or [http://ohnopub.net/~ohnobinki/tmp/supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-automagic.patch supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-automagic.patch]
#* Split physics, drawing, etc. apart
#** Which design pattern to use?
#* Find some way to change object constants without recompiling (sprites, Yeti bounds, velocities of various things, …)

== Things to do ==

* Fix bugs / things you don't like
* Make certain game is fun
* Update wiki pages (clean up design documents)
* New levels
* Enemies (bombfish, snowman, ninja snowball, forest enemies such as owl/zeekling...)
** Boss levels need lots of work (tree boss is confusing, totem pole is a piece of #@%&$, all are way too easy if you just stand in a corner)
* Expand levels to 25 tiles tall (max resolution is now 1280x800)
* Make certain camera/levels allow playing reasonably at 640x480 (min resolution)
