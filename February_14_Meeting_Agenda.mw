== Discussion ==

* (Unstable) release - soon (hopefully)
* WIP Google Code move
** Repository is synced up to latest version by grumbel
** SVN dumps are different for some reason (format change?)
** Still left: binary downloads, 0.3.1, bug tracker, wiki, etc. (decide which we want)
* Remove milestone 3 badguys so they stop cluttering up source tree? (would make World 2 unplayable) 
* http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/6794925041b61bdc5a941a5640914188-supertux-carry.png
** Small tux should not be able to go through 1-tile tall tunnels when carrying stuff (not that there should be any 1-tile tunnels in levels)
** Requires extending the hitbox
** Held item is not a shield (whereas it is in SMW3)
* Scons - remove completely (unsupported, debug build only)
* Semi-anonymous contributions (email/nick but no real name)
* Move external libraries out of tree and require them on the system itself (distro support?)
** tinygettext: [http://ohnopub.net/~ohnobinki/tmp/supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-required.patch supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-required.patch] or [http://ohnopub.net/~ohnobinki/tmp/supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-automagic.patch supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-automagic.patch]
* Source code cleanup
** Split physics, drawing, etc. apart
** Which design pattern to use?
** Find some way to change object constants without recompiling (sprites, Yeti bounds, velocities of various things, ...)
* Bug tracker workflow
** Still some bugs with patches floating around (either commit them or close as won't fix)
** Feedback is for requesting feedback or for stating that feedback has been given?

* Forest world is canceled? All we need are some ghost forest tiles/levels/badguys...

== Things to do ==

* Fix bugs / things you don't like
* Make certain game is fun
* Update wiki pages (clean up design documents)
* New levels
* Enemies (bombfish, snowman, ninja snowball, forest enemies such as owl/zeekling...)
** Boss levels need lots of work (tree boss is confusing, totem pole is a piece of #@%&$, all are way too easy if you just stand in a corner)
* Expand levels to 25 tiles tall (max resolution is now 1280x800)
* Make certain camera/levels allow playing reasonably at 640x480 (min resolution)
