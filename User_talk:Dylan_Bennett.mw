== Your upload of a new info block image ==

I noticed your upload of a new image for the Wiki's Main Page. You probably replaced the old one because you felt it didn't quite fit. Note, however, that the images on the Main Page are all in-game graphics and I would rather not see this changed. Moreover, the image you changed is also used in the user manual to explain the concept of the info blocks used in the game. For these reasons, I decided to revert the image back to the original version. Should you have wanted to propose a change of the in-game graphics instead, please get back to me, so we can discuss this. --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 12:50, 17 May 2007 (UTC)
