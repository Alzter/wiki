==Rejected User Ideas==

===Choose Audio output===

In options menu let player choose a sound output like OSS, aRts and so on.

:It isn't a good idea for SuperTux to be playing with this. If you need to change sound drivers, use the SDL environments variables: sdldoc.csn.ul.ie/sdlenvvars.php.

::The right place to change those settings would probally in a launcher application that starts before SuperTux itself and allows setting of sound driver, video resolution and other stuff, its a very common thing in Windows and might be a good idea under Linux as well, especially since those SDL environment variables are not exactly easy to find. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 07:47, 1 Aug 2006 (BST)

===Nazi Gnome===

* There should be in the game a Gnome dressed as a Nazi.
* The gnome should be fast, always jumping around , chase tux and not just be part of the scenario.
:Jawohl! Very gut idea. Make sure to add enough swastikas so ve can also get de "Banned in Germany" rating to boost de sales.
:Yep, I don't see how this could possibly fit into the game theme.
:Please no Hilter allusions. The badguys are not that bad. Same goes for Stalin, Bush or Mao. Don't even think about Saddam.
: I agree, bad idea.
:I agree,too no way!
