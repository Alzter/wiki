== SuperTux 0.3.0 ==
Released 2006-12-17, this is a preview of what is
to become Milestone 2. Lots of new features can already
be tried out, e.g. levels that scroll in all directions,
levels with multiple sectors, moving platforms, a shortened
ice world and a whole new forest world.

== SuperTux 0.1.2 ==
This is a release for the big SuperTux fans. We were asked to make more
levels, making some more challenging, so here's our answer. This
version has a brand new Bonus Island map, new map features, a new enemy
and some new tiles.

This version basically features the built-in editor that
was removed from the previous release (0.1.0), new hand-written fonts
and a few bug fixes.

== SuperTux Milestone1 aka 0.1.0 ==

Milestone1 is in huge parts the result of the GotM event on
[http://happypenguin.org happypenguin.org],
it contains completely new graphics, lots of new levels,
a story and a worldmap. Screenshots below should give you an
impression of the game.

=== Flexlay ===

Flexlay is the editor that was used to build most of the
levels and the Worldmap in Milestone1. It provides a few
more features than the build in one (zoom, minimap, worldmap
support), but requires a few more dependencies and OpenGL on
the other side.

== SuperTux 0.0.6 ==

Some shots from the 0.0.6 release, released at March 15,
2004. Basically this was a code clean-up version. Features a
level editor and an OpenGL front-end. Menu as improved a lot, and
fonts were also remade.

A couple of shots from our 0.0.5 release, released at December

== SuperTux prior 0.0.5 ==

Wow! These are really ancients shots from versions prior to
0.0.5. Graphics were a bit ugly, but it was already playable and
had a SuperMario1 feel.
