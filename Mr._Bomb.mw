MrBomb should be in the Forest levels, too.

Exploded bombs should be able to destroy or set fire to surrounding blocks

Bombs should be de-set-off by using ice spitting

Bombs should be carryable when iced

I agree with wat he said.
and bombs should be able to be picked up before exploding and thrown at enemys,walls,yourself(just joking)etc to destroy or kill the opposing wallor enemy, =)
