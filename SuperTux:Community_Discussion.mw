==Level 24==
Hey I just recently found your game and am stuck at level 24... I guess that there have to be blocks behind the water texture but I have no idea on how to figuere where are these... and I doubt it just comes to luck there. What am I missing? mfg DJGummikuh
:Just look closely and you will see there are single blocks to step on. You might want to ask on the [supertux.info/forums/ fansite forums] next time you need help, you'll get more responses there. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 22:35, 29 Jul 2006 (BST)

==Wiki external links==
This is just a note: I have realised that on the wiki, whenever an anon or normal user edits a page with external links on it, it will be without the <nowiki>"http:</nowiki><nowiki>//"</nowiki> part, essentially breaking the link. This can be troublesome for a page with lots of links on it. Sysops will then have to fill back the links.

Also, just a suggestion, maybe it would be a good idea to upgrade this version of MediaWiki, to prevent any security vulnerabilities. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 22:47, 29 Jul 2006 (BST)

I would upgrade if the MySQL version of wasn't too old. This have been discussed in #supertux and there is [http://developer.berlios.de/support/index.php?func=detailsupport&support_id=102138&group_id=1 a berlios bug] for it. Also [http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=8012&group_id=1 this bug about php not available on shell.berlios.de] blocks the update. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 00:21, 30 Jul 2006 (BST)

==Supertux being sold?!==
Has anybody else noticed that SuperTux is being sold at ClickGamer? The porters site is located here; www.oldray.net. Seems to also have made a one level demo available. While I know that the GPL permits this, I can't stand people it. I was planning to create a Pocket PC port before I found this. We should be able to get the source from this shouldn't we?
:You can download a Pocket PC Binary there. They call it a demo. Anyway, its a binary based on our GPL Code. As fas as I understand the GPL they have to give the source to everyone who has a Binary. --[[User:62.214.230.124|62.214.230.124]] 15:03, 2 Aug 2006 (BST)
:Is it possible to build the binary with the source included in the demo's .zip file?
::No idea, but looks like they did not change the level format. So why not create a package from the demo which includes all levels for free? Can someone with the right hardware test if that works? --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 16:08, 2 Aug 2006 (BST)
::: Just tested it on my PPC. All original SuperTux 0.1.3 levels work with the provided "demo" engine.
::Seems like the source code included with the "demo" engine is only for the original, unaltered versions. This is in direct violation of the GPL which forbids linking GPLed code with proprietary code. 
:::Not necessarily. They just have to give you the source if you ask for it, they don't have to ship it with the binary. So ask for it and if you don't get the source hand it over to gpl-violations.org.
BTW, my_defs.cpp does not look like original supertux code so better check again.
