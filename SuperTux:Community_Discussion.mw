=Iceflower?  What iceflower?=
Hey, I read about something called the "iceflower" and I thought it sounded pretty awesome.  I have not found it implemented anywhere in SuperTux 0.3.1 and I was wondering, is it just an idea that has been going around or is my version of SuperTux just old? --[[User:MegaTux|MegaTux]] 00:00, 21 March 2010 (UTC)

I got SuperTux from the Ubuntu Karmic Koala software center under the title SuperTux 2.  It was the latest version listed.  If there is an iceflower, and it is in a newer version of SuperTux, could somebody please ask the Ubuntu packager to upload a more recent version? \I found ice flower and ice cap graphics in game code, but it isn't implented in the game.



ANSWER - The iceflower is used in one of the levels that can be downloaded in 0.3.1

= Add-ons on Ubuntu =
I am running Ubuntu Karmic Koala, and the add-on feature is telling me that it is disabled.  From what I understand, if you build the source you can enable the feature by installing libcurl3.  I do not want to build the source code myself, as with previous experience I have normally destroyed my computer.

I was wondering if and when the package guy will build SuperTux with libcurl3 and add it as a dependency so that other users and I can install add-ons and stuff. --[[User:MegaTux|MegaTux]] 00:02, 21 March 2010 (UTC)

=Levels difficulty=
I'm new here, I've been playing 0.3.1 from fedora repo (i guess), but there's just one small thing that bothered me. The level difficulty is kind of inconstant. You go from a very easy level to a fork of two very hard levels and then the forks go back in (right at the beggining) to a bunch of easy levels, then you advance a lot, until you stop with a bunch of dead-ends of very hard levels, followed again by easier ones. I think level difficulties should be more linear like the easiest first then the harder... Anyway, great game, guys, keep it up... Also, the forest map is quite nice, like, less mario-clone and more original content...

= Music =
Helloes, I have two MIDI songs that I would like to contribute to SuperTux. Unfortunately, their file type (.mid) is not allowed for upload on the wiki, and I'm not interested in joining a file-sharing service. Any suggestions? [[User:Tuxnut|Tuxnut]] 23:44, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

== Cannot delete levels ==
Hi, I have linux. I have recently been in the leveleditor and made some of my own levels. But, whenever I say 'don't save' to a level that I just made, it appears in the 'bonus level' section. I think I have the first version where the evil penguin-guy takes Penny so I think it's the first one. Please help. I hope you understand what I just said!
:Your levels should be in <code>~/.supertux/levels</code>. Find the ones you don't want and delete them, and rename the rest so that they go in numerical order.

== Cave levels ==
I like the cave levels in the Icyisland world &ndash; finally, we get some contrast in the theme &ndash; but it really doesn't fit into the plot very well. Why would Tux want to enter an ice cave if he could simply go over or around it to get to Nolok's castle?

Here is one of the many ways to incorporate the cave levels into SuperTux:
:Tux first visits Nolok's castle, but realizes that nobody can enter without the key, which is located in the ice cave. Tux enters the ice cave, going deeper and deeper into the crystal mines (this is where Incubator Island levels like Crystal Beauty come in handy) until he finds the key. Then he escapes and enters the castle.
I don't know. As long as there's an explanation that works, I'm happy with it. [[User:Tuxnut|TUX/√UT]] ([[User talk:Tuxnut|plz talk 2 me internets]] | [[Special:Contributions/Tuxnut|view horrendous deeds]]) 18:49, 4 September 2010 (UTC)

== Profile folder ==
With SuperTux 0.3.3 on Windows, it possible to consolidate the profile folder (user/application data/supertux2) into the Program Files/SuperTux folder so that all the files are in one place? [[Special:Contributions/70.41.197.99|70.41.197.99]] 04:02, 19 December 2010 (UTC)


== SuperTux 0.3.3 contribute levels ==

Hi, i was thinking to make levels in 0.3.3 version, but how can i do it ? How can i create a worldmap? 
I was thinking to make levels and upload it, then, with the option in add-ons menu: Check online, then my worldmap with my levels and mod appears. How can i do it? (Sorry from my English)
:To create a worldmap use the editor. Either load an existing worldmap or switch the tileset in level - properties" to "images/worldmap.strf".

I've stopped playing supertux by moths... Before i remember how to do it now i don't. I have ST_ Editor in SuperTux 0.1.3 but, i never saw a editor! only in supertux 0.1.3 (ST_Editor V1.11)
I used now ST_Editor V1.11, but when i load any level or worldmap, nothing appears in the screen!

(Edit: I am telling version 0.3.3, not 0.1.3!)

:Never heard of ST_Editor V1.11. I use the editor from svn. Try [[Download/Unstable#Release_0.3.0]] if you don't compile from source.

Thank you for the download link. All works perfect, i can load levels and worldmaps, but a problem: When i move any object in worldmap or in a level, appears a box saying:

Supertux-Editor exception                                                     

Unexpected exception: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

How can i fix this ...? Even when creating a level it does the same error :(

I've made 3 mods to supertux 0.1.3 (world 2, bonus island 2 beta, a modified version of the island, and, my newest mod is: SuperTux 0.2.3 6-in-8 island mod).

I found superburgerworld on source forge and all it is is supertux w/ a few titles and images changed!

::I did a Google search and found superburgerwld.sourceforge.net. I also downloaded and went through the game a bit; it is exactly the same as the main world of SuperTux 0.1.3. However, it credits refer to the game being based off SuperTux (in fact, its credits include ''all'' of the original credits from the original game, even the "Milestone 2 is on its way..." part). The levels are exactly the same, with the level names and the some of the graphics changed, but the names of the authors of the original SuperTux levels remain. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 04:57, 28 Sep 2006 (CEST)
::: I'd say that's because of laziness on the "developer"'s part, and not giving credit. This guy is BSing too many people. The site doesn't give ANY credit to us Tuxers, and it's basically a complete ripoff with a few level titles changed and some added graphics that look like a 2-year-old scrawled them. I mean, honestly, they didn't even mod the Dark Snow tileset OR the Cave background, OR almost anything else. By the way, almost EVERYTHING that was in SuperTux that doesn't belong in SBW is still in there (images/backgrounds, the Tux icon in the Level Editor, the names of a lot of images...). The file for the non-Whopper burger is still "smalltux-right-1.png". That's laziness, not credit. Now, I posted a *clean* comment on their site. It's awaiting moderation, and it'll show up, if it does at all, as "Annoyed Tuxer" or something. The name suits me quite well right now. See the title of my edit for more info. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 00:16, 29 Sep 2006 (CEST)

Hi, I'm the guy who makes Super Burger World, I really don't mean to take any credit for any of the coding (I'm hopeless at it myself) but I thought that the ingame mentions were enough, however I will do more to make the fact it is based off of supertux more obvious. I don't spend much time on it (it shows) and I didn't think changing the filenames was worth the trouble. All I ever think this game to be is a bit of a skin to the original, I retained the SuperTux name on any part I didn't change. I let the comments through in case you are wondering, because I wasn't trying to take credit for any of the work that the developers did. So take a look at the site again in a day or so and comment either here or on the site if there is any more you would like me to do. My apologies to the developers if you thought your work was going uncredited

: Just browsed through the comments on your site. You should know that not all devs feel the same way - I, for example, feel honored by the fact that someone liked SuperTux enough to dedicate time and effort to making a mod. So, while I do agree that it should have been pointed out more clearly that SBW is a ST mod, don't think what you did particularly evil. Just point out where it's based on and stick to the license (i.e. keep it GPL), so people wanting to base work on SBW can do so. Anyway - thanks for sharing and keep up the good work! --[[User:84.146.249.203|84.146.249.203]] 19:12, 7 Oct 2006 (CEST)

: Much better. Thanks a ton. And there aren't any GPL violations, so no problem.

Hi, I'm the Super Burger World "developer", I just wanted to let you know that I signed up for an account here so in future there is an easy way of contacting me with regards to anything Super Burger World related. Just visit my talk page and write away.
