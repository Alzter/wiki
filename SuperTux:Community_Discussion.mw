=Iceflower?  What iceflower?=
Hey, I read about something called the "iceflower" and I thought it sounded pretty awesome.  I have not found it implemented anywhere in SuperTux 0.3.1 and I was wondering, is it just an idea that has been going around or is my version of SuperTux just old? --[[User:MegaTux|MegaTux]] 00:00, 21 March 2010 (UTC)

I got SuperTux from the Ubuntu Karmic Koala software center under the title SuperTux 2.  It was the latest version listed.  If there is an iceflower, and it is in a newer version of SuperTux, could somebody please ask the Ubuntu packager to upload a more recent version? \I found ice flower and ice cap graphics in game code, but it isn't implented in the game.



ANSWER - The iceflower is used in one of the levels that can be downloaded in 0.3.1

= Add-ons on Ubuntu =
I am running Ubuntu Karmic Koala, and the add-on feature is telling me that it is disabled.  From what I understand, if you build the source you can enable the feature by installing libcurl3.  I do not want to build the source code myself, as with previous experience I have normally destroyed my computer.

I was wondering if and when the package guy will build SuperTux with libcurl3 and add it as a dependency so that other users and I can install add-ons and stuff. --[[User:MegaTux|MegaTux]] 00:02, 21 March 2010 (UTC)

Lives: 9

Part 1: First 4 lives icicles drop where Tux is.

Part 2: Last 5 lives all icicles fall in a pattern.

=Levels difficulty=
I'm new here, I've been playing 0.3.1 from fedora repo (i guess), but there's just one small thing that bothered me. The level difficulty is kind of inconstant. You go from a very easy level to a fork of two very hard levels and then the forks go back in (right at the beggining) to a bunch of easy levels, then you advance a lot, until you stop with a bunch of dead-ends of very hard levels, followed again by easier ones. I think level difficulties should be more linear like the easiest first then the harder... Anyway, great game, guys, keep it up... Also, the forest map is quite nice, like, less mario-clone and more original content...

= Music =
Helloes, I have two MIDI songs that I would like to contribute to SuperTux. Unfortunately, their file type (.mid) is not allowed for upload on the wiki, and I'm not interested in joining a file-sharing service. Any suggestions? [[User:Tuxnut|Tuxnut]] 23:44, 14 June 2010 (UTC)
:Compress them as .zip or .gz and upload them on the [{{Mediawiki:Bugtracker-url}} bug tracker] in a new bug under "Sound and Music." --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 00:16, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

::::The bug tracker. I'm seeing a lot of bugs marked "new" and only a few marked "resolved" -_- [[User:Tuxnut|TUX/√UT]] ([[User talk:Tuxnut|plz talk 2 me internets]] | [[Special:Contributions/Tuxnut|view horrendous deeds]]) 19:34, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
:::::Most of the new "bugs" are people dumping their files there. What do you axpect the devs to do with them? Reject them would not be a smart move by pissing of users. Accept won't work either because how can you acept leves if noone knows what features are available in milestone 2. But yes, all the noise on the bugtracker sucks. I think about unsubscribing. --[[Special:Contributions/87.118.104.203|87.118.104.203]] 19:35, 21 June 2010 (UTC)
::::::Everyone with Subversion installed knows what features are available in Milestone 2. And of course, since these user levels are submitted by users, and only developer-made levels are decent, it naturally has to be pure junk, right?

::::::: Many of the features in svn are tagged as "to be removed" in the wiki. Maybe you missed that while reformatting the entries. See [[Grumbel grumbles]] for 
which levels are consider junk by the main developer. But you probably know that already. --[[Special:Contributions/173.244.197.210|173.244.197.210]] 16:36, 22 June 2010 (UTC)
::::::::I found this: ''Trash, junk and other garbage and we call it 'levels'. The svn needs really some large cleanup to seperate the useless testing stuff from the usefull [sic] ones and the testing from the actually playable.''
::::::::I believe he is talking more about the test/experimental levels included in the SVN (Bouncy Coils and Crumbling Path, e.g.) than the user-submitted content. But that's enough of this semi-trivial discussion; this bickering (especially on my part) is not why I created this section.

= Frame Delay Time? =
Hello, I'm new here, and I need to know the correct delay (in ms) between frames of a animation, as in a sprite. I've searched the source code, but there seems to be too much to sift through. Can anyone help me? --[[User:1a2a3a2a1a|1a2a3a2a1a]]
:Never mind, found it. (10 fps, or 100 ms) --[[User:1a2a3a2a1a|1a2a3a2a1a]]

= Screen Res? =

just installed SuperTux on my mac. the screen resolution is wrong, how can i change this?
: Use <code>--geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT</code>, as <code>supertux2 --help</code> should show. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 15:30, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

== Cannot delete levels ==
Hi, I have linux. I have recently been in the leveleditor and made some of my own levels. But, whenever I say 'don't save' to a level that I just made, it appears in the 'bonus level' section. I think I have the first version where the evil penguin-guy takes Penny so I think it's the first one. Please help. I hope you understand what I just said!
:Your levels should be in <code>~/.supertux/levels</code>. Find the ones you don't want and delete them, and rename the rest so that they go in numerical order.

== Cave levels ==
I like the cave levels in the Icyisland world &ndash; finally, we get some contrast in the theme &ndash; but it really doesn't fit into the plot very well. Why would Tux want to enter an ice cave if he could simply go over or around it to get to Nolok's castle?

Here is one of the many ways to incorporate the cave levels into SuperTux:
:Tux first visits Nolok's castle, but realizes that nobody can enter without the key, which is located in the ice cave. Tux enters the ice cave, going deeper and deeper into the crystal mines (this is where Incubator Island levels like Crystal Beauty come in handy) until he finds the key. Then he escapes and enters the castle.
I don't know. As long as there's an explanation that works, I'm happy with it. [[User:Tuxnut|TUX/√UT]] ([[User talk:Tuxnut|plz talk 2 me internets]] | [[Special:Contributions/Tuxnut|view horrendous deeds]]) 18:49, 4 September 2010 (UTC)

== Profile folder ==
With SuperTux 0.3.3 on Windows, it possible to consolidate the profile folder (user/application data/supertux2) into the Program Files/SuperTux folder so that all the files are in one place? [[Special:Contributions/70.41.197.99|70.41.197.99]] 04:02, 19 December 2010 (UTC)


== SuperTux 0.3.3 contribute levels ==

Hi, i was thinking to make levels in 0.3.3 version, but how can i do it ? How can i create a worldmap? 
I was thinking to make levels and upload it, then, with the option in add-ons menu: Check online, then my worldmap with my levels and mod appears. How can i do it? (Sorry from my English)
:To create a worldmap use the editor. Either load an existing worldmap or switch the tileset in level - properties" to "images/worldmap.strf".

I've stopped playing supertux by moths... Before i remember how to do it now i don't. I have ST_ Editor in SuperTux 0.1.3 but, i never saw a editor! only in supertux 0.1.3 (ST_Editor V1.11)
I used now ST_Editor V1.11, but when i load any level or worldmap, nothing appears in the screen!

(Edit: I am telling version 0.3.3, not 0.1.3!)

:Never heard of ST_Editor V1.11. I use the editor from svn. Try [[Download/Unstable#Release_0.3.0]] if you don't compile from source.

Thank you for the download link. All works perfect, i can load levels and worldmaps, but a problem: When i move any object in worldmap or in a level, appears a box saying:

Supertux-Editor exception                                                     

Unexpected exception: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

How can i fix this ...? Even when creating a level it does the same error :(

I've made 3 mods to supertux 0.1.3 (world 2, bonus island 2 beta, a modified version of the island, and, my newest mod is: SuperTux 0.2.3 6-in-8 island mod).
