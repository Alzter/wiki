Hi, I have linux. I have recently been in the leveleditor and made some of my own levels. But, whenever I say 'don't save' to a level that I just made, it appears in the 'bonus level' section. I think I have the first version where the evil penguin-guy takes Penny so I think it's the first one. Please help. I hope you understand what I just said!
