==Website update?==

I've built supertux from svn and saw all the great updates you guys have done. Don't you believe it's about time to let the world now a bit about it? Just like, let's say, a little piece of news with one or two screenshots on the front page, telling "we're not dead". Because I really thought supertux was a dying project, before managing to compile svn version.

==Level 24==
Hey I just recently found your game and am stuck at level 24... I guess that there have to be blocks behind the water texture but I have no idea on how to figuere where are these... and I doubt it just comes to luck there. What am I missing? mfg DJGummikuh
:Just look closely and you will see there are single blocks to step on. You might want to ask on the [supertux.info/forums/ fansite forums] next time you need help, you'll get more responses there. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 22:35, 29 Jul 2006 (BST)

==Wiki external links==
This is just a note: I have realised that on the wiki, whenever an anon or normal user edits a page with external links on it, it will be without the <nowiki>"http: </nowiki><nowiki>//"</nowiki> part, essentially breaking the link. This can be troublesome for a page with lots of links on it. Sysops will then have to fill back the links.

Also, just a suggestion, maybe it would be a good idea to upgrade this version of MediaWiki, to prevent any security vulnerabilities. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 22:47, 29 Jul 2006 (BST)

I would upgrade if the MySQL version of wasn't too old. This have been discussed in #supertux and there is [http ://developer.berlios.de/support/index.php?func=detailsupport&support_id=102138&group_id=1 a berlios bug] for it. Also [http ://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=8012&group_id=1 this bug about php not available on shell.berlios.de] blocks the update. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 00:21, 30 Jul 2006 (BST)

==Supertux being sold?!==
Has anybody else noticed that SuperTux is being sold at ClickGamer? The porters site is located here; www.oldray.net. Seems to also have made a one level demo available. While I know that the GPL permits this, I can't stand people it. I was planning to create a Pocket PC port before I found this. We should be able to get the source from this shouldn't we?
:You can download a Pocket PC Binary there. They call it a demo. Anyway, its a binary based on our GPL Code. As fas as I understand the GPL they have to give the source to everyone who has a Binary. --[[User:62.214.230.124|62.214.230.124]] 15:03, 2 Aug 2006 (BST)
:Is it possible to build the binary with the source included in the demo's .zip file?
::No idea, but looks like they did not change the level format. So why not create a package from the demo which includes all levels for free? Can someone with the right hardware test if that works? --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 16:08, 2 Aug 2006 (BST)
::: Just tested it on my PPC. All original SuperTux 0.1.3 levels work with the provided "demo" engine.
::Seems like the source code included with the "demo" engine is only for the original, unaltered versions. This is in direct violation of the GPL which forbids linking GPLed code with proprietary code. 
:::Not necessarily. They just have to give you the source if you ask for it, they don't have to ship it with the binary. So ask for it and if you don't get the source hand it over to gpl-violations.org.
BTW, my_defs.cpp does not look like original supertux code so better check again.
::::I think that the GPL is much more strict than that.  I think it is against the license to modify the sources, and distribute those modifications without those modifications also falling under the GPL.  Since those modifications apparently fall under a commercial license, it is already a GPL violation.  By his own admittance, it is a derivative work. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 22:15, 4 Aug 2006 (BST)
:::::No. The GPL allows for reselling GPLed software for profit. How else would people get away with selling pre-burned Linux CDs and DVDs? I know it sounds twisted, but there's nothing we can do. --[[User:Djwings|DJ 
Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 17:48, 10 Aug 2006 (BST)
::::::The GPL says that you can sell GPL software for money, but only physically (on CD, not on the net).
::::::Yes, the GPL allows selling GPLed software, but it clearly states that all derivative work must be distributed under the GPL, not any other license (the "commercial license", the website in question mentions).
::::The fishy part about all this is "Commercial part of license covers work and time spent to change source code and other resources to make SuperTux playable on Pocket PC platform.", if that commercial part goes into the binary and no source code is provided its a clear violation, otherwise its fine. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 06:31, 8 Aug 2006 (BST)
:::::The GPL in section 2 part b says, "You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third    parties under the terms of this License." or in English, "If you make a program out of this one, it has to be licensed under the GPL only."
::::::Since they're charging money for all of it except the demo (and they're not distributing the source with it), not to mention they're selling it as a download and not a CD, this is a violation. Course of action? Someone should make them aware of this, a "cease-and-desist" email if nothing else. By the way, check this out: [yro.slashdot.org/yro/06/09/23/1655248.shtml GNUs fighting back!]--[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 17:04, 24 Sep 2006 (BST)
:I can see no problem with that. All the source code is included in the /supertux/qvgadata/distr/st_src.tar.bz2 so everyone can download it and play for free. Is there any other problem? --member of oldray.net
::That is fine to me as long as you a. relicense what you have done to GPL, and b. clearly advertise where the source is on your website.  Even better would be to let us keep a SVN repository, then you become an unofficial official maintainer of it, or merge it with main ST using #ifdef wherever. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 17:51, 25 Sep 2006 (BST)

To answer a few questions from above:
* You do not need to put modifications of GPL'ed software under the GPL if you only use it '''internally'''. As soon as publish it, you need to.
* You can sell the game over whatever medium you like.
* You do not need to include the source code with the binary distribution, but you '''must''' provide a written offer for the source code, licenced under the GPL, via the same medium. In this case, a download.
* Only a copyright holder is able to send a cease and desist. This means i can not send them any. Neither can Harald of www.gpl-violations.org. I am sure he will be more than happy to help you guys, send one, though. Each and everyone of you devs: Get together, contact Harald and make 'oldray' an unhappy ''dev''.
