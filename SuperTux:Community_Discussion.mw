==Level 24==
Hey I just recently found your game and am stuck at level 24... I guess that there have to be blocks behind the water texture but I have no idea on how to figuere where are these... and I doubt it just comes to luck there. What am I missing? mfg DJGummikuh
:Just look closely and you will see there are single blocks to step on. You might want to ask on the [http://supertux.info/forums/ fansite forums] next time you need help, you'll get more responses there. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 22:35, 29 Jul 2006 (BST)

==Wiki external links==
This is just a note: I have realised that on the wiki, whenever an anon or normal user edits a page with external links on it, it will be without the <nowiki>"http://"</nowiki> part, essentially breaking the link. This can be troublesome for a page with lots of links on it. Sysops will then have to fill back the links.

Also, just a suggestion, maybe it would be a good idea to upgrade this version of MediaWiki, to prevent any security vulnerabilities. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 22:47, 29 Jul 2006 (BST)

I would upgrade if the MySQL version of wasn't too old. This have been discussed in #supertux and there is [http://developer.berlios.de/support/index.php?func=detailsupport&support_id=102138&group_id=1 a berlios bug] for it. Also [http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=8012&group_id=1 this bug about php not available on shell.berlios.de] blocks the update. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 00:21, 30 Jul 2006 (BST)
