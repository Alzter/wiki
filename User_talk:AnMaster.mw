Hello, I'm frenh so there is maybe a few mistakes.
I'm interested in this project and I don't know C++, but I can do something wih pictures and design ( I will maybe learn C++), I'm on windows (I haven't my own computer and my parents don't want Linux) and I know the wiki language very well. Because of my language, I haven't understood what I can do. Could you help me ? (I understand the english but please write simple words<br/>Thank you<br/>[[User:Vivelefrat|Vivelefrat]] 09:22, 4 July 2007 (UTC)

Hi. I want to port the SuperTux level editor into Java so I can run it (Doesn't work with Mono for me; I have the error messages written downb if you want them) Will you support the ported version? (I do plan to develop it further) [[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 15:53, 15 October 2007 (UTC)
:What other reasons did you have for not wanting to port it to Java, by the way? (Oh, and I responded to the level converter question on my page) [[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 01:26, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
::As I said, I don't know java at all and have no interest in learning it. If you code a level editor in java, fine, but don't ask me to support it. I'm more than happy to help with questions about level format and such (IRC preferred, #supertux on irc.freenode.net) --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 10:58, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
::Oh I should add to that: IRC, European evening (I'm in GMT+1) --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 11:07, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
:::One quick question on level/S-expr format: Is it case-sensitive? [[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 01:07, 29 October 2007 (UTC)
