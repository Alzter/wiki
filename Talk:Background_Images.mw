What about having the top and bottom segments variable vertically and the middle segment not... or why not have all three segments variable vertically? -F50

: If more than one segment is variable vertically, how would you determine where one segment ends and the other one starts? You'd have to define a point where that happens, and then you could just as well give one of them a fixed size. -Wansti

: Of course you could define that point new for every level... I'll keep it in mind. -Wansti
