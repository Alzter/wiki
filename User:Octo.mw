Hi, my name is ''Florian Forster'' and I usually go by the nick of “octo”. I'm committing to the SVN repository as “florianf”.

You can contact me on ''freenode'' and via email and Jabber at <code>&lt;octo&nbsp;at&nbsp;verplant.org&gt;</code>. My GnuPG key is <code>0x91523c3d</code>, but my mails to the ''SuperTux'' mailing list are not signed (the content type isn't allowed). My homepage is at http://verplant.org/

Regards,<br />
—octo

== Levels ==

I have made a couple of own levels. They are described on my homepage at: http://verplant.org/supertux/

To get the newest version of the levels, check out my Git repository at
 git://git.verplant.org/supertux-levels.git
There's also a [http://git.verplant.org/?p=supertux-levels.git;a=summary Gitweb interface] to the repository.

Please note that these levels are made with the latest SVN version at that time. If you find anything broken in a version ''newer'' than the levels, please let me know.

== Release checklist ==

* Set <code>SUPERTUX_VERSION</code> in {{SvnFile|CMakeLists.txt}}.
* Replace image in {{SvnFile|data/images/objects/logo/logo.sprite}}<br />''logo_dev.png → logo.png''
