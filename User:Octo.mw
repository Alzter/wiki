Hi, my name is ''Florian Forster'' and I usually go by the nick of “octo”. I'm committing to the SVN repository as “florianf”.

You can contact me on ''freenode'' and via email and Jabber at <code>&lt;octo&nbsp;at&nbsp;verplant.org&gt;</code>. My GnuPG key is <code>0x91523c3d</code>, but my mails to the ''SuperTux'' mailing list are not signed (the content type isn't allowed). My homepage is at http://verplant.org/

Regards,<br />
—octo
