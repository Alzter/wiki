==What happens when there is a badguy collision while Tux is carrying something?==
When there is a collision from the top, behind, or below, there is no change in behaviour.  The behaviour when carrying something and when there is a collision in the front is dependent on what the something is.
===MrIceBlock===
MS1 Behaviour: Ice block and other badguy neutralize each other and fall off the screen.

We should try to maintain this behaviour for MS2, and probably all badguy portables should exhibit the behaviour as well.  There just aren't any other badguys that are portable. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 16:55, 30 Jul 2006 (BST)
:Why should a stunned badguy in front of tux protect him from hits in the back? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:57, 31 Jul 2006 (BST)

===Rock===
Rocks could shatter, which is similar to the behaviour of the proposed behaviour of the MrIceBlock portable, or could act like a shield so that nothing can hurt Tux by colliding from the front.  The shield may seem like a super-powerup, but all portables still have the disadvantage that Tux can't run, and many badguys now attempt to hurt tux from above. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 16:55, 30 Jul 2006 (BST)
:No, if you want a shield create a shield. Destrying a rock can make a level unsolvable which is worse than a downgrade from big to small. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:57, 31 Jul 2006 (BST)
