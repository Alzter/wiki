which deleted content made by other editors. I have replaced the content. If you would like to add content, do so without deleting other editors' contributions.
You also recently made an [{{fullurl:Talk:Argrystone|diff=prev&oldid=13431}} edit] to [[Talk:Argrystone]] which could be seen as spam. I have removed the content. Please refrain from making edits like that in the future. -- Qwood [[Special:Contributions/Qwood|(contribs)]] [[User talk:Qwood|(talk)]] 22:27, 3 July 2011 (UTC)
