As a side note, if this is you:

or if the IP you are using is indeed a Tor exit node I would suggest you simply leave this wiki now. -- Qwood [[Special:Contributions/Qwood|(contribs)]] [[User talk:Qwood|(talk)]] 05:07, 16 July 2011 (UTC)

== Tor Exit Node ==

By the way, using [http://www.projecthoneypot.org/ip_199.48.147.4 Tor] to complain about language on a wiki is fairly hypocritical. Tor is not only based around anonymity but freedom from censorship as well. -- Qwood [[Special:Contributions/Qwood|(contribs)]] [[User talk:Qwood|(talk)]] 05:20, 16 July 2011 (UTC)
:and it protects from stalkers like you who google for your ip. --[[Special:Contributions/192.251.226.206|192.251.226.206]] 11:40, 16 July 2011 (UTC)
