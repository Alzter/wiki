Hi. I don't want to be a pain, so I apologize if this is stupid. How do you place the checkpoint or midpoint of a level?
:I assume you mean a reset point (that is a point that if you die at you will start again at it). Place a "Reset Point" object where you want it. Can be found in the object list just below the bad guys.<br />Note that this FAQ is for the SuperTux-sharp editor for SVN and '''not''' for the editor built into SuperTux 0.1.2/0.1.3. ''If'' you are using the 0.1.3 built in editor: you can't place a reset point, use flexlay instead or edit the file by hand.<br />--[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 16:03, 24 Oct 2006 (CEST)
