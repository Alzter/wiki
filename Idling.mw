Sometimes tux stands just still. To make things more interesting we should have some animations in this case as well.

Examples:
* shaking his head
* flapping his flaps
* open/close an eyelid
* tapping his feet in impatience
* getting more and more angry the longer he is left.

It would also be nice to make him turn and face the 'camera' if an idle timer was exceeded.
