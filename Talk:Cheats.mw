IMHO, cheat codes should be used as a development tool only. If the majority votes for allowing players to cheat, there should at least be some kind of punishment for cheating, for example: No statistics, limited cutscenes, a big fat label saying "CHEATER!" in a place where everyone can see it, all of the above, something like that. - Wansti


I think there should be some funny cheats, or gimmiks, like play Beastie or Konqi. This is of no advantage to the player, just abit of hidden fun.
