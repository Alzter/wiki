IMHO, cheat codes should be used as a development tool only. If the majority votes for allowing players to cheat, there should at least be some kind of punishment for cheating, for example: No statistics, limited cutscenes, a big fat label saying "CHEATER!" in a place where everyone can see it, all of the above, something like that. - Wansti


I think there should be some funny cheats, or gimmiks, like play Beastie or Konqi. This is of no advantage to the player, just abit of hidden fun. - Tux the Penguin

:::do_cheer() in [[ScriptingPlayer]] is probably consolized.  I'm not sure it actually works yet. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 21:11, 31 Jul 2006 (BST)
::::do_cheer() is meant for when finding a key. In the console you can reach it using <tt>sector.Tux.do_cheer()</tt> Currently it does a backflip, it will be changed --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 21:15, 31 Jul 2006 (BST)
::Why do you think it's called '''hidden'''? Not much of a secret if it were in this wiki. --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 22:39, 31 Jul 2006 (BST)
:::Because I'm unaware of any such secret and couldn't find any in the code. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:35, 31 Jul 2006 (BST)
