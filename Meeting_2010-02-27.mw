The '''2010-02-27 meeting''' was held on ''Saturday, February&nbsp;27<sup>th</sup>'' at ''15:00&nbsp;UTC'' on [[IRC]].

Present were:
* [[User:Octo|octo]]
* [[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] (very short)
* MMlosh
* [[User:Grumbel|grumbel]]
* [[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]]

== Minutes ==

=== Project management ===

* (Unstable) Release - how?
** [[User:Octo|octo]] has a release tarball that needs testing.
** Tasks to be done (by who?):
*** Upload tarball to file server (BerliOS? Google? Lethargik?)
***: People listed at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/supertux/ as "admins" can upload to BerliOS.
*** Update download page http://supertux.lethargik.org/download.html
***: Probably sik0fewl
*** Announce on ''freshmeat.net'' (Project there by AnMaster?)
***: AnMaster and WolfgangB
*** Announce on http://happypenguin.org/
***: Can be done by everybody
*** Update bug tracker
***: → octo'll do it
*** Binary packages?
**** According to ''WolfgangB'', ''SuperTux'' did provida Linux autopackage and Windows binaries along the source tarballs.
**** Previous Windows binaries were built by "Delta" / "Sommer"
* Last chance to change [[Versioning scheme]]
* Next meeting date and time - every Saturday at 15:00 UTC?

=== Gameplay ===

* Feedback for the [[Yeti]] level.
** Postponed (again) because Mathnerd314 wasn't there.
* New tiles from grumbel - which are useful?
* Milestone 1-like worldmap - do now or later (which ideas to keep from the new one?)
** "Now" meaning before the release?
** [[User:Octo|octo]] has a version of the [[Milestone 1]] worldmap in [[Milestone 2]] syntax.
* Screw the forest? Keep for now? Don't delete ever?
* New names for badguys. Which to rename and (if applicable) which name to use?:
** [[Bouncing Snowball]] → Bouncy
** [[Flying Snowball]] → Avior or Dex
** [[Kamikaze Snowball]] → Snowshot
** [[Mr. Bomb]] → Fuse
** [[Jumpy]] → Recoil

=== Source code ===

* Split physics, drawing, etc. apart
** Which design pattern to use?
* Find some way to change object constants without recompiling (sprites, Yeti bounds, velocities of various things, …)
* Proposal - merge src and data of objects/enemies together so that all content is in only a single folder (i.e., folder data/mrtree/ would contain mrtree.?pp, mrtree.sprite, mrtree.ogg, left-*.png, etc.)
** Slightly harder to build and distribute packages (exclude *.?pp from data directory in binary builds)
** Easier to take out/add objects, because there's less to keep track of
* Switch to some physics engine?
** Features needed for everything to work:
**# tilemaps (or a good broadphase and efficient collision data format)
**# static constraint solver (so Tux doesn't get stuck on tile edges; problem in Box2D/Chipmunk)
**# raycasting (ispy)
**# kinematic objects (HitResponse FORCE_MOVE)
**# AABB queries (Drawing to screen)
**# custom collision callbacks/handlers/listeners/filters (all that collision code in MovingObject)
**# wheel joints (bicycle platform, unused except for test levels)
**# sliding joints (pneumatic platform, also only a test level)
**# path constraints/motors (for moving tilemaps/platforms)
