The '''2010-02-27 meeting''' was held on ''Saturday, February&nbsp;27<sup>th</sup>'' at ''15:00&nbsp;UTC'' on [[IRC]].

Present were:
* [[User:Octo|octo]]
* [[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] (very short)
* MMlosh
* [[User:Grumbel|grumbel]]
* [[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]]

== Minutes ==

=== Project management ===

* (Unstable) Release - how?
** [[User:Octo|octo]] has a release tarball that needs testing.
** Tasks to be done (by who?):
*** Upload tarball to file server (BerliOS? Google? Lethargik?)
***: People listed at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/supertux/ as "admins" can upload to BerliOS.
*** Update download page http://supertux.lethargik.org/download.html
***: Probably ''sik0fewl''
*** Announce on ''freshmeat.net'' (Project there by AnMaster?)
***: ''AnMaster'' and ''WolfgangB''
*** Announce on http://happypenguin.org/
***: Can be done by everybody
*** Update bug tracker
***: → octo'll do it
*** Binary packages?
**** According to ''WolfgangB'', ''SuperTux'' did provide Linux autopackage and Windows binaries along the source tarballs.
**** Previous Windows binaries were built by "Delta" / "Sommer"
* Last chance to change [[Versioning scheme]]
** Nobody felt it necessary to discuss this again. ''Mathnerd314'', who put it on the agenda, wasn't there anymore.
* Next meeting date and time - every Saturday at 15:00 UTC?

=== Gameplay ===

* Feedback for the [[Yeti]] level.
** Postponed (again) because ''Mathnerd314'' wasn't there.
* New tiles from grumbel - which are useful?
** ''grumbel:'' nightcave is good, the rest is crap
** ''grumbel:'' Make "Crystal cave" into a background tileset
** ''grumbel:'' the snowmountain stuff needs to be repainted
** ''WolfgangB, octo:'' If tilesets should be removed, do this ASAP (before they are used in levels by 3rd parties)
** → ''octo'' will make Crystal cave tiles non-solid so they cannot be used as interactive tiles.
* Milestone 1-like worldmap - do now or later (which ideas to keep from the new one?)
** "Now" meaning before the release?
** [[User:Octo|octo]] has a version of the [[Milestone 1]] worldmap in [[Milestone 2]] syntax. Use that or work on the current version?
** The worldmap has been changed just before the meeting ({{Revision|6419}}) by ''Mathnerd314''.
** ''WolfgangB:'' in a stable release the worldmap should fit with the levels e.g. some mountains on the map for cave levels
* Screw the forest? Keep for now? Don't delete ever?
** '''Motion:''' Restore the Milestone 1 worldmap and add the intro and Yeti levels. There will be no passage to/from the Forest and the Forest / World 2 will be moved to contributed levels.
*** '''In favor:''' octo, grumbel
*** '''Opposed:''' ''nobody''
*** '''No opinion:''' AnMaster
** → Motion passes.
* New names for badguys. Which to rename and (if applicable) which name to use?:
** [[Bouncing Snowball]] → Bouncy
** [[Flying Snowball]] → Avior or Dex
** [[Kamikaze Snowball]] → Snowshot
** [[Mr. Bomb]] → Fuse
** [[Jumpy]] → Recoil
*: ''AnMaster:'' in general I prefer the older names there. well, maybe not for "Kamikaze Snowball"
*: ''WolfgangB:'' if grumbel thinks the badguys need new names do it
*: ''octo:'' I don't like "Avior" nor "Dex". With the other names I don't have much preference
*: ''grumbel:'' what we want is good and interesting names. finding them is the hard part
*: ''MMlosh:'' The only change I agree with is Flying snowball rename. Snowshot is good, "Bouncy" has too strong association to java game shipped with nokia phones
*: '''→''' ''Avior'' and ''Dex'' are off the stove. ''Kamikaze Snowball'' will be renamed to ''Snowshot''. The other names are postponed until later.
