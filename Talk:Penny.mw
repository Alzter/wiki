I just wanted to ask why not giving penny some accessoires which are making her more feminin? sorry, but i don t like her look! 
perhaps it could be possible to give some accessoires to tux as well, at all he looks IMHO a little bit to clean!Accessoires

:*I'm thinking maybe Penny gets the ice-hat, opposed to Tux's fire-hat? I've tried it... --Julius Freezer
