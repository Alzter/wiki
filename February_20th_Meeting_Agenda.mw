The '''next developer's meeting''' will be held on ''Saturday, February&nbsp;20<sup>th</sup>'' starting at ''15:00&nbsp;UCT''. Anybody interested in ''SuperTux'' is invited to participate. The discussion will be held on IRC, network ''freenode'', channel ''#supertux''. Minutes of the meeting will be made available at [[Meeting 2010-02-20]].

The following are topics we would like to discuss. Since it's possible that we cannot address all the below issues, we might postpone some issues for a later meeting.

== Discussion ==

# Project management
#* (Unstable) Release - now?
#* Decide whether to finish up forest (ghost) world or to improve world 1 some more
# Gameplay
#* Feedback for the [[Yeti]] and [[Above the Arctic Skies]] levels.
#* Decide which new enemies to implement/rewrite first (bombfish, snowman, ninja snowball, forest enemies such as owl/zeekling...)
# Source code
#* Split physics, drawing, etc. apart
#** Which design pattern to use?
#* Find some way to change object constants without recompiling (sprites, Yeti bounds, velocities of various things, â€¦)
# Next meeting date and time - every Saturday at 15:00 UTC?

== Things to do ==

* Enhance documentation in <code>AUTHORS</code> ({{Bug|578}}).
* Fix bugs / things you don't like
* Make certain game is fun
* Update wiki pages (clean up design documents)
* New levels
** Boss levels need lots of work (tree boss is confusing, totem pole is a piece of #@%&$, all are way too easy if you just stand in a corner)
* Expand levels to 25 tiles tall (max resolution is now 1280x800)
* Make certain camera/levels allow playing reasonably at 640x480 (min resolution)
