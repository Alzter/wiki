## Welcome to the SuperTux Wiki

Welcome to the SuperTux wiki. If you would like to improve this wiki or correct mistakes, please contact us, preferrably via the Issue tracker or via IRC. We are always interested in new or experienced developers, artists and testers. If you would like to help, please see the _Contributing_ section in the links below.

The current release of SuperTux is 0.4.0.

This wiki is currently missing some stuff ( more than some ;)), but our [Old Wiki](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Main_Page) has a lot more information.
 Beware though that information on our old wiki may be out of date and confusing.

#### For players

* Since now there were no written **rules**. It was OK, but we have to write the **rules**, because some people though that there are no **rules** at all. Therefore:
 * No spamming, No off-topic posts, you know right.
 * No flaming. This is a forum and not a flamewar.
 * Representing the majority or the development team is strictly forbidden.
 * Please don't ask for help about unrelated topics (e.g. git). If you're told to look for external resources on such a topic, please do so.
