This Wiki is used to document the current state of
[SuperTux](https://www.supertux.org) as well as keep track of proposed
additions and changes.

This Wiki is targeted at the developers of the game, not users, users
are however free to check out what is going on behind the scenes.

The [old Mediawiki based Wiki](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Main_Page) has been merged
into this Wiki and has been switched to read-only mode. It is no
longer updated, but it can still be viewed.

Guidelines and tips for using this Wiki
---------------------------------------

* [[News]] is for keeping track of what is going on in SuperTux
  development. Every substantial addition or change to the game should
  be documented here.

* Do not delete information from this Wiki unless it is completely out
  of date or otherwise useless, prefer moving it over to [[Ideas]],
  [[Reject Ideas]] or another appropriate place instead.

* Use Markdown (`.md`) for the Wikipages.

* Use line-breaks at around 80 characters, the `.md` files are meant to
  be viewed and edited in a text editor

* Run the [validator.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/SuperTux/supertux/validator.py)
  in the Wiki repository to check for broken links.

* New pages should go to the [[_Sidebar]] for easy access.

* Prefer big pages, don't fracture content over too many small pages.

* Users without write access to this project need to use the
  [wiki repository](https://github.com/SuperTux/wiki/wiki) to submit
  changes via pull requests, directly editing this Wiki is disabled
