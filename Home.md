## Welcome to the SuperTux Wiki

Welcome to the SuperTux wiki. If you would like to improve this wiki or correct mistakes, please contact us, preferrably via the Issue tracker or via IRC. We are always interested in new or experienced developers, artists and testers. If you would like to help, please see the _Contributing_ section in the links below.

The current release of SuperTux is 0.4.0.

This wiki is currently missing some stuff ( more than some ;)), but our [Old Wiki](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Main_Page) has a lot more information.
 Beware though that information on our old wiki may be out of date and confusing.
