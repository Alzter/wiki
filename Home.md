## Welcome to the SuperTux Wiki

Welcome to the SuperTux wiki. 
If you would like to help fix this wiki, please make an issue/pull request [here](https://github.com/SuperTux/wiki/)

The current release of SuperTux is 0.4.0.

This wiki is currently missing lots of info, but our [Old Wiki](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Main_Page) has a lot more information, although a lot is outdated, and confusing.

#### For players

Until now there were no written rules. It was OK, but we now need to write the rules, because some people seem to think that there are no rules at all. Therefore:
 * No spamming, No off-topic posts, you know right.
 * No flaming. This is a forum and not a flamewar.
 * Representing the development team is strictly forbidden, unless you are a member of the development team and the representation has been agreed upon.
 * Please try to search the web (and this wiki, for example) to see if you can find resources to fix a problem (e.g. with Git) before asking a member of the team. We are willing to help, but our time is precious, and we wish to develop, not troubleshoot.
