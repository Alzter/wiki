= About =
This is a little writeup about the configuration of the openal SI implementation which is used on linux, bsd and others (MacOS/X and Windows have their own implementations which are different). Unfortunately there seems to be no documentation about how to configure alsa yet, so we provide this as an interim solution.

= Configuration File =
OpenAL is first trying to read a user settings from an .openalrc in the users home directory if it exists ($HOME/.openalrc). If it can't be found then /etc/openalrc is used. If this also fails the following default settings apply:

 (define speaker-num 2)
 (define display-banner #t)
 (define source-gain 1.0)

This is from the source code, however there seems to be no code to handle display-banner and source-gain...

= Settings =
These have been obtained by looking at the openal 0.0.8 source...

== General ==
* '''devices''' contains a list of devices which are tried as openal output devices. Possible values are:
** '''dsp''' - OSS (Open Sound System) driver
** '''native''' - Prefered driver for the platform (will load a driver for darwin, morphos, solaris, windows, bsd, alsa or dsp)
** '''alsa''' - ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound System) driver, only available on linux
** '''arts''' - ARTS, the KDE Sound Daemon
** '''dmedia''' - DMEDIA, seems to be the irix sound api...
** '''esd''' - ESD (Enlightenment Sound Daemon), often found on GNOME installations
** '''sdl''' - SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer), uses the SDL library for sound output
** '''null''' - NULL, no output
** '''waveout''' - Writes to .wav files
* '''direcion''' - unclear...
* '''sampling-rate''' - The sample rate used for mixing and sound output
* '''speaker-num''' - The number of speakers (2 for stereo speakers and headsets, 4,5,6 are supported on alsa for surround sound)
* '''source-rolloff-factor''' - default rolloff factor ([http://www.openal.org/oalspecs-annote/attenuation-by-distance.html#AEN507])
* '''device-params''' - unclear...

== ALSA Specific ==
* '''alsa-device''' - The alsa device used for sound input and ouput (used when alsa-out-device or alsa-in-device is not defined)
* '''alsa-out-device''' - The alsa device used for sound output
* '''alsa-in-device''' - The alsa device used for sound input

== DSP Specific ==
* '''lin-dsp-path''' - Path to the audio device (default /dev/dsp)
* '''lin-dsp-read-path''' - Path for audio output device

== DMEDIA ==
* '''dmedia-out-device'''
* '''dmedia-in-device'''
* '''dmedia-rear-out-device'''

== Darwin ==
* '''native-backend-debug''' - set to true for debugging

== Examples ==
Normal linux config, try alsa and dsp, then fallback to arts and esd or no audio. Stereo sound in CD Quality (44,1khz):

 (define devices '(alsa native arts esd null))
 (define alsa-device "default")
 (define speaker-num 2)
 (define sampling-rate 44100)

ALSA surround sound with a 5.1 sound system and 48khz high quality audio:

 (define devices '(alsa))
 (define speaker-num 6)
 (define alsa-out-device "surround51:0,0")
 (define alsa-in-device "hw:0,0")
 (define sampling-rate 48000)
