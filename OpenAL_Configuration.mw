= About =
This is a little writeup about the configuration of the openal SI implementation which is used on linux, bsd and others (MacOS/X and Windows have their own implementations which are different). Unfortunately there seems to be no documentation about how to configure alsa yet, so we provide this as an interim solution.

= Configuration File =
OpenAL is first trying to read a user settings from an .openalrc in the users home directory if it exists ($HOME/.openalrc). If it can't be found then /etc/openalrc is used. If this also fails the following default settings apply:

 (define speaker-num 2)
 (define display-banner #t)
 (define source-gain 1.0)

This is from the source code, however there seems to be no code to handle display-banner and source-gain...

= Settings =

* '''devices''' contains a list of devices which are tried as openal output devices. Possible values are:
** '''dsp''' - OSS (Open Sound System) driver
** '''native''' - Prefered driver for the platform (will load 1 of the others)
** '''alsa''' - ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound System) driver, only available on linux
** '''arts''' - ARTS, the KDE Sound Daemon
** '''dmedia''' - DMEDIA, seems to be the irix sound api...
** '''esd''' - ESD (Enlightenment Sound Daemon), often found on GNOME installations
** '''sdl''' - SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer), uses the SDL library for sound output
** '''null''' - NULL, no output
** '''waveout''' - Windows Waveout device, only available on windows
* '''direcion'''
* '''sampling-rate'''
* '''speaker-num'''
* '''source-rolloff-factor'''
* '''device-params'''
