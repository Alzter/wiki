This is a list of ideas. These are mostly features that could be added to
SuperTux at some point in the future. These will certainly need more discussion
in the future.

### Artwork

#### Graphics

- Different players? (very low priority)
- Forest
  - Tile variance
    - Snowy Forest (needs discussion)
- Wasteland
  - Tiles and Background as pictured in the upper left-hand corner of
        <http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/9/97/Forestworldoverview.jpg>
  - Worldmap tileset
- Improve stone graphics of Tux
  - [Mantis 1072](http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=1072)
- Portable objects (needs discussion)
  - Grabbing
  - Tux running while holding portable objects
- Wallstone tileset and backgrounds

#### Levels

- Tileset variance: Snowy Forest (needs discussion, needs graphics if we
    decide to add)

### Code

- Ice crusher sound should be deeper / lighter depending on size of icecrusher sprite.
- Ice floe as a game object (might also depend on fluid simulation as game
    object)
- Mega Tux power up (suggested in issue [#582](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/582))
- Arrow key navigation for text fields.
- Squirrel code completion for MN_SCRIPT items. This is a huge undertaking, but easier for people who want to get into scripting.
- Exporting created levelsets / worldmaps as ZIP files
- Upon dropping a layer / badguy onto the sector, open its properties (configurable in Options).

### GamePlay

#### Suggested Tiles

Some new suggested tile types from [[Tiles]]:

* Slime/Mud - Slow down Tux's movement
* Quicksand - Tux could sink slowly in this and be slower than usual

#### Rope
this could also be implemented as a jungle vine especially for world 2 - zratchet

Tux is turning into Indiana Jones. Swinging on ropes, having darts fired at him by skulls on the wall, acquiring artifacts...but I kind of like that. --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 14:07, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

#### Sonic Spin Dash

HOw about something like Sonic the Hedgehog's rev up spin dash?
A rev up sliding move.  Or, a Sonic Clone as a project.  Slide dash away.
 Also would be cool to have loops

*Maybe Tux can destroy things with his beak when sliding. I like the sliding idea as all penguins do it.
