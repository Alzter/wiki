This is a list of ideas. These are mostly features that could be added to
SuperTux at some point in the future. These will certainly need more discussion
in the future.

### Artwork

#### Graphics

- Different players? (very low priority)
- Forest
  - Tile variance
    - Snowy Forest (needs discussion)
- Wasteland
  - Tiles and Background as pictured in the upper left-hand corner of
        <http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/9/97/Forestworldoverview.jpg>
  - Worldmap tileset
- Improve stone graphics of Tux
  - [Mantis 1072](http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=1072)
- Portable objects (needs discussion)
  - Grabbing
  - Tux running while holding portable objects
- Wallstone tileset and backgrounds

#### Levels

- Tileset variance: Snowy Forest (needs discussion, needs graphics if we
    decide to add)

### Code

- Ice crusher sound should be deeper / lighter depending on size of icecrusher sprite.
- Ice floe as a game object (might also depend on fluid simulation as game
    object)
- Mega Tux power up (suggested in issue [#582](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues/582))
- Arrow key navigation for text fields.
- Squirrel code completion for MN_SCRIPT items. This is a huge undertaking, but easier for people who want to get into scripting.
