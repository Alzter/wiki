== The trouble with lightmaps ==
Why remove "Levels that use lightmaps"? T
: Because they cause weird bugs on Windows, and even on Linux they don't work perfectly. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 08:53, 28 Sep 2006 (CEST)
::They don't work? Which levels are we talking about here? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 00:53, 29 Sep 2006 (CEST)
:::"Light and Magic" crashes at unpredictable intervals upon entering the level. No time to investigate yet, so it's an optional bonus level for now --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 12:48, 14 Nov 2006 (CET)
::::The magic blocks in l&m are planned for ghost forest IIRC. Are they in 1.9 at all? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 21:59, 14 Dec 2006 (CET)
:::::Light and Magic hasn't crashed for me and I am a windows user. The blocks that are solid when only a correct color lantern is near are great. the ghost rendering is also good.

==Problems with alpha installer for Windows==
The alpha installer by delta___ doesn't seem to use the tools/innosetup/supertux.iss file. The editor depends on the game using this one to build the installer (as the installer for the editor checks for some ids to make sure supertux is installed). --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 10:22, 5 Oct 2006 (CEST)

==Entering Small Island on World 2==

There is a small island on the top right corner of world2, how do you enter it?
: It's a secret island that can be reached via a teleporter in [[World 2]]. It wouldn't be a secret island if I told you how to reach it, now would it? Besides, it would spoil all the fun searching for it! --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 12:44, 14 Nov 2006 (CET)
:: I don't see a teleporter, is it invisible?
::: Yes, it is hidden behind a tree --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 13:32, 16 Nov 2006 (CET)
::::What about the small island in World 1? The teleport there doesn't seem to work. How can I get there?
:::::The teleport works. It's just not where one might suppose it to be --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 21:12, 21 Dec 2006 (CET)
I found the teleport on island 2! Also, in bonus island 2, on the secret island that has the level 'End of the Ice Age' there is another path to the right of it. does it lead anywhere and if so please give me a small hint to where the teleporter is.

World 1 hint: if I told you I would be leading you into a dead end.[[User:Atomic1fire|Atomic1fire]] 04:33, 10 Jan 2007 (CET)

==Editor Error==

When you try to open a level or worldmap in the windows 0.3.0 editor, you get an error "Error loading level: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation" Any solutions?
: You might be trying to open a SuperTux 0.1.x level. Sadly, the editor cannot import those yet. <br />Converting SuperTux 0.1.x levels to the new 0.3.x format isn't too hard to do (just open an old and a new level in a text editor to see the differences), but I wrote a short Scheme script to do the conversion for you. You can download it at from svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/*checkout*/supertux/branches/supertux/0_3_x/tools/levelconverter-0.1.3_0.2.0.scm?rev=4257<br />Alternatively. mail me the old level and I'll mail back a converted version to you. --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 13:37, 16 Nov 2006 (CET)
:: A 0.1 level would not result in that error message. The message would be: "Couldn't load level: Old Level Format not supported". What I suspect is that you haven't set the path to the supertux data directory correctly. But without details I can't say what it is. What is needed is: the message shown after clicking on the small "+" in front of the text "Details" in the error message box and the level level file itself. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 13:53, 16 Nov 2006 (CET)

: What did you do to get that one and what graphic card do you use? All I can say from that message is that it is OpenGL related and that it happened somewhere in code outside the SuperTux code itself (in the system file "GLU.dll"). Even with the info of what you did to make it happen, it would probably be quite hard to debug that one. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 09:42, 18 Nov 2006 (CET)

I have been expriencing 410 errors for the last 6 weeks. Was anything up with the site? Anyways, I have a Trident Cyberblade XP Ai1 video card and I got this error by trying to open a level.

If you say the problem is GL related, is there an editor that uses SDL?

== Release Date ==

We should release Milestone 1.9 soon. Best case this or next weekend, but at least before Xmas, then we can work on MS2 during the holidays and fix the newly reported problems.

== Mac Binary ==

I'm not too sure on all the details and workings of Mac OS X app bundles, but I think I may have a semi-working binary.  I'll have to give it a test on another system to make sure 3rd party deps don't need to be installed with the binary.  Also need to make it a UB as right now it's compiled for Intel only.  If anyone has any more experience with this, please let me know (msg jayson or EvilGlowingApple in #supertux).  I'll post back when i have a fully working version.

==Difference between green and orange poison ivy==

What is the difference beetween the green and the orange poison ivys? Infact, they look more like Venus Fly traps.

: The green poison ivy will happily walk off any ledge, even if this means certain death. The orange poison ivy is somewhat smarter: It will never drop from ledges. By the way: SuperTux 0.3.0 also knows a third type of ledge behaviour which is still smarter. Some badguys, like Mr. Iceblock, will only drop off ledges if they do not fall offscreen. Also, badguys in SuperTux 0.3.0 always behave the same; it's no longer up to the level author to define whether badguys should stay on platforms --[[User:217.231.215.83|217.231.215.83]] 07:30, 7 Jan 2007 (CET)
