Behaviour: walks, runs if ants are in front of it... grows by eating ants

Look: An Anteater

Hurt Tux: if he is smaller than it. Perhaps the front of anteater (Mr Anteater?) is harmless, but pushes Tux along, thus pushing him off edges or into other badguys. The tail of Anteater could swish from side to side and hurt Tux.

Hurt it: jump or spit
