== Tips to make levels and worldmaps better ==
* Do not make levels where they come only from left to right, but think other directions, which way would be walked (from right to left, from top to bottom, from bottom to top, zigzag and other directions).
* Sometimes make a detour to the bonus, which would not have to go. It should not be overstated. A player should know which way is the way to the finish.
* Do the impossible to get to the finish before you fulfill a task such as pressing a button, to get somewhere, grab something, and others.
* Unlocking archivements: The player must achieve special targets in different levels for reach a level.
* Use heterogeneous environment.
* Use scripts.
* Add some bonus-levels to your worldmap.
* Make multi-sector levels.
