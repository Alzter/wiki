== Tips to make levels and worldmaps better ==
* Do not make levels where they come only from left to right, but think other directions, which way would be walked (from right to left, from top to bottom, from bottom to top, zigzag and other directions).
* Sometimes make a detour to the bonus, which would not have to go. It should not be overstated. A player should know which way is the way to the finish.
* Do the impossible to get to the finish before you fulfill a task such as pressing a button, to get somewhere, grab something, and others.
* Unlocking archivements: The player must achieve special targets in different levels for reach a level.
* Use heterogeneous environment.
* Use scripts.
* Add some bonus-levels to your worldmap.
* Make multi-sector levels.

== SuperTux criticisms ==
# IcyIslan - extro: What will happen with Tux, when done level "The castle of Nolok"? He roots and blossoms there?
# Water in 0.3.0: When you jump into the water splash sounds. Water in 0.3.3: This effect was deleted. Why??
# When I go to the end of the level and try to get out of level, Tux is moving a bit beyond the level.
# The result of burning wood is ash, but not fall below the screen.
# Lot of test levels are unfinishable.
# Level "Easter egg demo": The secret area has a parameter "message", but it does not work.
# The hitbox of plant is wrong.
# Smoke effects was removed. Why??
# I do not like using nicknames for badguys. Correct names are those which are listed below in SuperTux levels.
# There are unused badguys.
# Owl wins the competition for the snubest badguy.
# There are no owls in levels "owls' revenge".
# Owl is very demanding for operating memory. I do not understand why.
# Fireball is not looks like fireball.
# New sprite for jumpy? It's not looks bad, but it hasn't an image for action "iced".
# Difference of width Tux and Penny is too big.
# Tux and Penny speak during a picnic, but they do not open the beak.
# Cave levels from IcyIsland in worldmap aren't in cave.
# Owls can not carry badguys.
# Menu in 0.3.x: theres are menu border. Menu in 0.3.3-svn-r6694: the border was removed. Why??

== SuperTux rebith plan ==
Admins are very slow. Everyone, who tried contrib them something is only waiting for admin's opinion. I thing, It's not possible to only wait. There is a faster way. I need some waiting contributors for complete this plan. Your contributions will be added to SuperTux. I need someone, who can edit SuperTux source code, someone, who can draw good graphics and someone, who can create levels. If you can something else useful for SuperTux, you can join us too. Please, ask me please on my e-mail: teratux.mail@gmail.com for more information. If you are an angry waiting contributor, then join us. You can join us on my e-mail.
:Or you could always keep the open source spirit and fork the project. Non-existent development is, IMO, a completely justified and respectful reason to do so. I wish you luck; I would enjoy seeing more done on Supertux. [[Special:Contributions/75.162.30.18|75.162.30.18]] 23:40, 12 October 2011 (UTC)
::Yes, nobody can ban the develop in SuperTux devel team. I thought fork the devel of SuperTux. --[[User:Hume|Hume]] 18:01, 18 October 2011 (UTC)
