== Tips to make levels and worldmaps better ==
* Do not make levels where they come only from left to right, but think other directions, which way would be walked (from right to left, from top to bottom, from bottom to top, zigzag and other directions).
* Sometimes make a detour to the bonus, which would not have to go. It should not be overstated. A player should know which way is the way to the finish.
* Do the impossible to get to the finish before you fulfill a task such as pressing a button, to get somewhere, grab something, and others.
* Unlocking archivements: The player must achieve special targets in different levels for reach a level.
* Use heterogeneous environment.
* Use scripts.
* Add some bonus-levels to your worldmap.
* Make multi-sector levels.

== SuperTux critics ==
# IcyIslan - extro: What will happen with Tux, when done level "The castle of Nolok"? He roots and blossoms there?
# Water in 0.3.0: When you jump into the water splash sounds. Water in 0.3.3: The effect was deleted. Why??
# When I go to the end of the level and try to get out of level, Tux is moving a bit beyond the level.
# The result of burning wood is ash, but not fall below the screen.
# Lot of test levels are unfinishable.
# Level "Easter egg demo": The secret area has a parameter "message", but it does not work.
# The hitbox of plant is wrong.
# Smoke effects was removed. Why??
# I do not like using nicknames for badguys. Correct names are those which are listed below in SuperTux levels.
# There are unused badguys.
