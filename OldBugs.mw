* The titlebar of the browser in this wiki shows "Wikipedia" instead of "SuperTux" when logged in.
*:Can't reproduce that problem. Works fine here. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 00:30, 15 Sep 2006 (BST)
*:: I've sometimes noticed with certain sites that exiting a tab (in Firefox) will not update the titlebar.  Right now the CSS on the wiki is messed up for me, but I know it is just me.  --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 00:48, 15 Sep 2006 (BST)
*:::It's still there. I'm using Opera 9 on Ubuntu Dapper
*:::: So am I, but I don't experience anything like it. Maybe a custom skin? Can you give steps to reproduce? --[[User:84.146.251.243|84.146.251.243]] 14:02, 29 Oct 2006 (CET)
*:::::I simply log in, and when logged in every single page has "Wikipedia" instead of "SuperTux". I am not using any custom skin or such. --Shylence 18:24, 3 Nov 2006 (CET)
*::::::Well I see SuperTux when I login. '''Nowhere''' does it say Wikipedia. Can you please tell where exactly you see Wikipedia on any page? --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 20:35, 3 Nov 2006 (CET)
*: Probably because you set the Wiki to output non-english content. Wikimedia comes in 86 different languages and SuperTux-specific strings were only added for some of them. The Wiki now forces an english locale for all users until we have localizations for the rest of the supported languages. --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 13:50, 4 Nov 2006 (CET)
*::I was using Italian language pack, works fine with English one. Sorry for the trouble. --Shylence 17:09, 4 Nov 2006 (CET)

== Release 0.1.3 ==

* When using OpenGL renderer, water transparency is not shown. Using software renderer (SDL), water alpha looks just fine. Could you check out why transparency does not work for some people? Experienced with the binary-only ATI video driver (fglrx) for ATI Radeon X200M video card.
* If an enemy kills [[Tux]] and the user elects to abort the level before he falls off the screen, gameplay may continue with negative lives. This happens when Tux looses his last life.
* The texture.cpp file has an incorrect texture type (GL_RGB10_A2). Only ATI (FGLRX) drivers will interpret it correctly and will display a non-transparent waterfall in OpenGL. It's better to use GL_RGBA here since most drivers (ex. mesa) interpret GL_RGB10_A2 as GL_RGBA
* Widely experienced bug: After compiling v0.1.3 from source on Ubuntu Linux 5.10 "Breezy Badger", the game crashes after choosing "Bonus Levels" from the main menu, although going into a 26-level game slot doesn't -djwings
*: Solved by upgrading to Dapper. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 16:40, 24 Sep 2006 (BST)
* I was able to walk throug the end of the level without finishing it. It happend while playing witw 12 frames/seconds.
* The jumping heads with spikes sometimes only jump to the level of a passing cloud.
* Enter key is completely ignored on a Compaq Pressario, but works fine with other SDL-based games (e.g. Falcon's Eye) (by jessejoe)
*: Can be worked around by custom-compiling with all SDLK_RETURN replaced by 271
* Tux is unable to grab Mr. Iceblock while blinking after losing a bonus (eg. Big Tux -> Small Tux).
* The Mac OS X version seems to have some transparency problems in OpenGL mode. eg. you can easily see the 'hidden' coins at the end of the first level.
* supertux doesn't compile with gcc-4.1.1. At line 210 of menu.h the 'Menu::' qualification needs to be removed (it is already a Menu:: member and this is no longer allowed in gcc-4.1.1).
* Level editor: Object selection tool doesn't work when the last tool used was a badguy; it works fine when following a tile tool. Also, when a badguy's deleted, the property button doesn't gray out; clicking it causes a segment violation/GPF/segfault/crash.
*Save file gets corrupted (has zero length) when free space on storage device runs out during the game.
=== Not a bug ===
* After running the configure script without any options and compiling the source in the supertux-0.1.3.tar file, SuperTux crashes with the error 'Couldn't load musicfile', and reports the filename with a complete absolute path (which is correct -- SALCON.mod). Bug produced with a Slackware 9.1 system. -> Your SDL_mixer library is probably compiled without mikmod support or you grabbed 1 of the versions where mikmod support was broken.
* Tux can junt to the top and out of the screen when a platform reaches the upper limit. This allowa to bypass certain zones.
*: Intended behaviour
* If you have the big Tux, hit a box with a flower and then for some reason you are attacked and reverted to the small Tux, when picking up the flower you'll be big Tux in fire mode.
*: Intended behaviour
*Enemies need not to fall down from the platforms. This reduces enemy number.
*:Eremm... This happens in many Mario games.
*:Anyway. Not a bug. If this was a feature request, please add this to the list of [[Ideas]]
*:Isn't this is a badguy characteristic?  Some badguys fall off, others don't.  --tuxdev
*:: In [[Milestone 1]], this could be configured separately for each guy on the screen. [[Milestone 2]] will have that as a Badguy-dependent setting, i.e. [[MrBomb]] never walk off ledges, [[Spiky]] will only walk off if he won't fall offscreen, A [[Snowball]] won't care and happily drop off every ledge.

== Release 0.1.2 ==
* The sound slightly lags. Bug produced with Fedora Core 2.
* If an enemy kills [[Tux]] and the user elects to abort the level before he falls off the screen, gameplay may continue with negative lives.
* When opening hand-edited levels/maps that have incorrect syntax, SuperTux crashes with an unmoveable mouse.
* SuperTux takes up more memory on each new level/game, until it crashes the systems. Using KDE System Guard suggests that finished maps/levels are not being freed from memory. Bug produced on a Knoppix/Debian system with 128MB of RAM.
