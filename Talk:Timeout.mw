==How should timeouts affect the player?==
MS1 behaviour: ???

Current r4079 behaviour: Shrink Tux and kill him immediately on timeout.

The timeout should be extended the safe time from shrinking so that annoying time critical levels are somewhat less annoying less annoying.  The safe time might be less than normal so that it doesn't fudge it too much.  [[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 22:48, 24 Jul 2006 (BST)

No Timelimit. At least not in any level on a worldmap. --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 23:13, 24 Jul 2006 (BST)

Yes, we want to avoid time limits, but sometimes they are critical to the level.  Example level "Train Leaves in One Minute", or bonus1/abendigo4.  [[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 23:40, 24 Jul 2006 (BST)
