If you would like to contact us, give us a hand with developing, or just say hi, you can use a very handy tool called IRC, which alows you to live chat with the Supertux team. 

NOTE: If you drop by but no one answers in a couple minutes ,don't leave. The Devs try their best to respond promptly, but they have lives away from the computer just also.



Our channel is #supertux on irc.freenode.net. Also available [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=supertux&uio=d4).

Hope to talk to you there!!!
