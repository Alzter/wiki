'''Walking Rock''' is a big rock, unharmed by spikes, fireballs, enemies and such, usable by Tux as a platform.

Example (I used [[Badguys concept art|Grumbel's sketch for Granito]]):

:the walking rock could push Tux if he gets in his way and kill him if squished by a wall.That would be interesting.
