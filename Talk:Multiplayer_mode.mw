I really think that we should first design a solid singleplayer game before even thinking about this. The games primary focus should be the singleplayer. - Matze

:If there is a 2nd Player mode, who woudl teh 2nd characetr be? Maybe Tux's Albino cousin :-).

I agree with Matze. The game should be close to complete before we start on this. It could be a lot of work and slow the development speed down. - Drahcir
