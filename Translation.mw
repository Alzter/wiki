== How to Translate ==
* Check at the end of this site if someone else is already working on the translation for your language. If there is someone contact him/her!
* Install [http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ gettext]
* Get an [[Download/Subversion|SVN snapshot]] of SuperTux and do the usual <tt>autogen.sh</tt>, <tt>configure</tt>. ''Make sure configure can find the xgettext application. (i.e. "checking for xgettext... xgettext" and "checking if xgettext supports Lisp... yes")''
* Run <tt>jam</tt>, let it compile SuperTux and create all the <tt>messages.pot</tt> files
* Go into data/locale and data/levels/*/ and in each of those directories:
** In case you want to create a new translation, run:
 msginit -i messages.pot -o $LANG.po
 (where $LANG is the two-character handle of your language)
** In case you want to update an existing translation, issue the following command:
 msgmerge -U $LANG.po messages.pot

* Edit the .po files with your favourite editor or with one of the GUI tools below.
* Send the translated .po files to the [[Mailing Lists|supertux-devel mailing list]].
* You should also edit the supertux.desktop file and add a comment entry for your language.

== Notes for Translators ==
* If there isn't a good translation for some term (i.e. fullscreen), you might consider to simply keep it in English. It's better than confusing the user.

* In English, there is only one singular second person form (you). If your language has more than one - a personal and impersonal - remember that this is a game, so you should use the personal one. Note that if it can be omitted your language, you should probably do so.

* Names like SuperTux, Tux, Penny or Nolok should not be translated. If you really think one of these is too strange for your language, first inform us on our mailing list. Names of minor characters like Mr. Ice Block can (and should) be translated.

* If somewhere in the game, after translating a string, it doesn't look well (bad aligment, overlaps other text...), let us know and we will fix it.

* Do not stick to the original text too much, just try to capture the meaning of a phrase.

* Have a friend play the game using your translation. If any phrase needs additional explanation, consider changing it.

== Tools ==

There's a number of tools you can use to edit the .po files:

* [http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/ KBabel] - matured KDE translation program
* [http://poedit.sourceforge.net/ poEdit] - multi-platform po editor (runs on Windows and Unix/Linux)
* QTranslator - comes with Qt, also multi-platform
* (X)Emacs - commonly used for translation with the respective plugin
* Any text editor - of course you can also simply use a text editor. Just make sure the file encoding really matches the stuff stated in the .po header.

Please add yourself to this list if you are working on a new translation, so that others can contact you.
