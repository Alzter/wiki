= How to Translate =
* Check at the end of this site if someone else is already working on the translation for your language. If there is someone contact him/her!
* Install gettext
* get a cvs snapshot of supertux and do the usual autogen.sh, configure.
Make sure configure can find the xgettext application. (ie. "checking for xgettext... xgettext" and "checking if xgettext supports Lisp... yes")
* Run 'jam' and let it compile supertux and create all the messages.po files
* Go into data/locale and data/levels/*/ and in each dir do:
** In case you want to create a new translation do
 msginit -i messages.pot -o $LANG.po
 (where $LANG is the 2character handle of your language)
** In case you want to update an existing translation do
 msgmerge -U $LANG.po messages.pot

* Edit the .po files with your favourite Editor or with 1 of the GUI tools below.
* Send the translated .po files to the supertux-devel mailing list.
* You should also edit the supertux.desktop file and add a comment entry for your language

= Notes for Translators =
* If there isn't a good translation for some term (ie. fullscreen), you might consider to just keep it. It's better than making the user confused.

* In English, there is only one singular second person mode (You). If your language does have more than one - a personal and impersonal - remember that this is a game, so you should use the personal one. And if it is possible to ommit it in your language, it might be a good idea.

* Names like SuperTux, Tux, Penny or Nolok should not be translated. If you really think one of these to be a too strange word for your people, first inform us at our mailing list. Minor characters like Mr. Ice Block can (and should) be translated.

* If somewhere in the game, after translating a string, it doesn't look well (bad aligment, overlaps other text...), let us know - we will fix it.

= Tools =

There's a number of tools you can use to edit the .po files:

* __KBabel__ - matured KDE translation program
* poedit.sourceforge.net poEdit - multi-platform po editor (runs on windows and unix/linux)
* QTranslator - Comes with Qt, also multi-platform
* (X)Emacs - commonly used for translation with the respective plugin
* Any text editor - Of course you can also simply use a text editor. Just make sure the file encoding really matches the stuff stated in the .po header
