== How to Translate ==
# Check at the end of this site and on the [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/search.php?project_id=0&category=Translations&sticky_issues=on&sortby=summary&dir=DESC&hide_status_id=-2 Issue Tracker] if '''someone else''' is already working on the translation for your language. If there is someone contact him/her!
# If you already have '''messages.pot''' files you can skip this step. If you don't already have messages.pot files (the files that contain all the text that can be translated) you can have them created for you by following these instructions:
#* Install [http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ gettext]
#* Get an [[Download/Subversion|SVN snapshot]] of SuperTux. You then have two ways to make the templates:
#** '''Compile SuperTux''', making certain CMake finds xgettext.
#** '''Run the makepot.sh shell script''', making certain xgettext is in your path. You may have to edit makepot.sh slightly to enlarge the list of level subsets.
# '''Create or update the .po files''' for your language. Many GUI tools (see below) will help you with this, so if you indeed to use one you can skip this step. Here's how to do things yourself:
#* Go into data/locale and data/levels/*/ and in each of those directories:
#** In case you want to create a new translation, run <tt>msginit -i messages.pot -o $LANG.po</tt> (where $LANG is the two-character handle of your language)
#** In case you want to update an existing translation, issue the following command: <tt>msgmerge -U $LANG.po messages.pot</tt>
# '''Edit the .po files''' with your favourite editor or with one of the GUI tools below.
# You should also edit '''supertux.desktop''' and add a comment entry for your language.
# Either '''send''' the translated .po files to the [[Mailing Lists|supertux-devel mailing list]], or upload them to the [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/search.php?project_id=0&category=Translations&sticky_issues=on&sortby=summary&dir=DESC&hide_status_id=-2 Issue Tracker].

== Notes for Translators ==
* If there isn't a good translation for some term (e.g. "Credits" or "Sound"), you might consider to '''simply keep it''' in English. It's better to allow users to make an educated guess than to confuse them by displaying '''meaningless''' or garbled text.

* In English, there is only one singular second person form: "You". If your language has more than one - a '''personal''' and an '''impersonal''' form - remember that this is a game, so you should use the personal one. Note that if it can be '''omitted''' your language, you should probably do so.

* Names like '''SuperTux, Tux, Penny or Nolok''' should not be translated. If you really think one of these is too strange for your language, first inform us on our mailing list. Names of minor characters like '''Mr. Ice Block''' can (and should) be translated.

* If somewhere in the game, after translating a string, it doesn't look well ('''bad aligment''', overlaps other text...), let us know and we will fix it.

* Do not stick to the original text too much, just try to '''capture the meaning of a phrase'''. This especially true for level names, which often play on phrases only known to english speakers. In this case it's often better to make up a level name that is close to the original, but doesn't use a '''wordplay'''.

* Have a friend '''play the game''' using your translation. If any phrase needs additional explanation, consider changing it.

== Tools ==

There's a number of tools you can use to edit the .po files:

* [http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/ KBabel] - matured KDE translation program
* [http://poedit.sourceforge.net/ poEdit] - multi-platform po editor (runs on Windows and Unix/Linux)
* QTranslator - comes with Qt, also multi-platform
* (X)Emacs - commonly used for translation with the respective plugin
* Any text editor - of course you can also simply use a text editor. Just make sure the file encoding really matches the stuff stated in the .po header.

== Translations ==
SuperTux [[Milestone 2]] supports localization. This means you can play SuperTux in any of the languages supplied with the game, as well as make your own translation.

SuperTux will try to auto-detect what language to display text in. If auto-detection fails or if you want to play in a certain language, you can force SuperTux to use a specific locale by setting the LANG environment variable to the handle of your language (e.g. "en"; see the following sections for all available languages).

Setting an environment variable can be done in a number of ways, depending on your operating system.

Linux users might run
 LANG="en" ./supertux

Windows users might run
 set LANG=en
 supertux.exe

If setting the environment variable <tt>LANG</tt> doesn't work, you may try using the variable <tt>SUPERTUX_LANG</tt> instead.

== Existing Translations ==

Please add yourself to this list if you are working on a new translation, so that others can contact you. Please log in if you change an entry in this list.
