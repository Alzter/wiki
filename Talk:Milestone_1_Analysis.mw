* ?-blocks don't indicate at which side they where bumped
** MatzeB: IMO being able to bounce ? blocks from 2 sides to affect direction of the egg was a pointless feature anyway... 
** Grumbel: it was pointless without backscrolling, with backscrolling however I consider it pretty essential, it should simply be a bit more obvious (block jumping/rotating into the direction it was bumped).

Since I'm not a developer I don't really have a say, so I thought I'd put this on the discussion page.  Personally I enjoyed having the side feature of the ? blocks in Milestone 1, and it's one of the biggest things I miss in Milestone 2.  I know a few people that liked that feature, mostly because it made the game even more Mario-like.
