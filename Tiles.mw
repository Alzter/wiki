Interactive tiles are actually just special game objects. This page lists some possible interative tile types.

* Ice - Like normal tile, but Tux has a harder time speeding up and slowing down on ice
* Spikes - When Tux lands on a spike he is injured
* Water - Tux will be able to jump into water and swim around and will also slow down Tux's movement
* Slime/Mud - Slow down Tux's movement
* Lava/Fire - Injure Tux
* Quicksand - Tux could sink slowly in this and be slower than usual
