'''Walking Leaf''' is a bit smarter than the ordinary badguy, but not much. Just smart enough to stay on
it's platform instead of jumping down. The Leaf will hurt tux on contact and can be killed the usual
ways. Since it is more careful it is walking a bit slower than the average badguy.

At the moment, the Leaf uses a redish version of [[Poison Ivy]], feel free to improve that.
