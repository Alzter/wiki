[[Image:Leaf.png|thumb]]'''Walking Leaf''' is a bit smarter than the ordinary badguy, but not much--just smart enough to stay on its platform instead of jumping down. The Leaf will hurt Tux on contact and can be killed the usual ways. Since it is more careful, it is walks a bit slower than the average badguy.

At the moment, the Leaf is a reddish version of [[Poison Ivy]]; feel free to improve that.
