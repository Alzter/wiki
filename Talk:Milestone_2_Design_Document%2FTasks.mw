== Protection ==

Since Milestone 2 Design Document is protected, this ought to be as well. Or do you want users to add tasks? --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 01:48, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

* Tasks for Next Two Weeks: Maybe that should be simply "Task List", since there are already tasks for 10 weeks+badguys



== Merge AngryStone and IceCrusher ==

Currently, these two don't actually behave the same - IceCrusher moves only up and down, while AngryStone moves along a grid ~6 tiles apart. AngryStone is actually kind of interesting... although the [[Milestone 3 Design Document#Angry_Stone|documentation]] says that AngryStone should be IceCrusher. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 14:27, 7 May 2008 (UTC)

== Sprite Rotation ==

This is already implemented; see sprite->set_angle in block.cpp. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 02:01, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
