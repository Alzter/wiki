== Protection ==

Since Milestone 2 Design Document is protected, this ought to be as well. Or do you want users to add tasks? --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 01:48, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

* Tasks for Next Two Weeks: Maybe that should be simply "Task List", since there are already tasks for 10 weeks+badguys

* Maybe it's okay for it to be locked, as long as an administrator is available to check this discussion page and cross off things that are done, and insert other notes that people specify here...but ''only'' then, because people would want to be able to do that for themselves if it weren't for crazed Spammers and the like.

:P.S. If there '''is''' one reading this, I'd like him to add to the "remove pictures from credits" section, "Yeah, I too like them there. I think they belong there, and anyways whether or not they should be there should ''really'' be voted on by the people's whose pictures they are."



== Merge AngryStone and IceCrusher ==

Currently, these two don't actually behave the same - IceCrusher moves only up and down, while AngryStone moves along a grid ~6 tiles apart. AngryStone is actually kind of interesting... although the [[Milestone 3 Design Document#Angry_Stone|documentation]] says that AngryStone should be IceCrusher. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 14:27, 7 May 2008 (UTC)

== Sprite Rotation ==

This is already implemented; see sprite->set_angle in block.cpp. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 02:01, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
