==Current Implementation==

* Purple, winged critter, that just flies in a straight path.
* an experimental -hideandzeek patch makes the Zeekling invisible until she is only 1/3 screen away from the player

==Proposal 1==

===Behaviour===
* zigzag flight

===Appearance===
* paroneayea's domain...

===Attack===
* can steal your powerups, but no actual getting him (i.e doesn't smallify)

===Vulnerabilities===
* if you can catch it you can jump on it. You can also retrieve stolen powerups

==Proposal 2==

===Behaviour===
* flies at tops of levels unless Tux is below, then drops to try to catch him and take him to another area

===Appearance===
* bigger and different color than #1

===Attack===
* can drop you in bad places

===Vulnerabilities===
* with invulnerability shield or maybe electricity

==Proposal 3==

===Behaviour===
* Flies in a staight path
* Swoops down when it sees Tux

===Appearance===
* paroneayea's decision

===Attack===
* Touches [[Tux]].
* Most likely to hit Tux during the swoops

===Vulnerabilities===
* Can be jumped on
* Ice, fire, electricity
