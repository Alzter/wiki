==Proposal 1==

===Behaviour===
* Zigzag flight

===Appearance===
* paroneayea's domain...

===Attack===
* Can steal your powerups, but no actual getting him (i.e doesn't smallify)

===Vulnerabilities===
* If you can catch it you can jump on it. You can also retrieve stolen powerups

==Proposal 2==

===Behaviour===
* Flies at tops of levels unless Tux is below, then drops to try to catch him and take him to another area

===Appearance===
* Bigger and different color than #1

===Attack===
* Can drop you in bad places

===Vulnerabilities===
* With invulnerability shield or maybe electricity

==Proposal 3==

===Behaviour===
* Flies in a staight path
* Swoops down when it sees Tux

===Appearance===
* paroneayea's decision

===Attack===
* Touches [[Tux]].
* Most likely to hit Tux during the swoops

===Vulnerabilities===
* Can be jumped on
* Ice, fire, electricity
