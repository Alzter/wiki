Hey! Welcome to my user page. <br>
I'm one of the newer members of the dev team. I beta-test, submit ideas, clean up the wiki, and occasionally find/fix bugs (haven't come across many yet). As of 9/16, I'm having trouble installing all the necessary packages (jam, openal, openal-dev, libphysfs) to build SuperTux svn, though, following a switch to Zenwalk. I'll start contributing once I get slapt-get working.
