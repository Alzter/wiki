Hey! Welcome to my user page. <br>
I'm one of the newer members of the dev team. I beta-test, submit ideas, clean up the wiki, and occasionally find/fix bugs (haven't come across any yet). As of 9/16, I had trouble installing all the necessary packages (jam, openal, openal-dev, libphysfs) to build SuperTux svn following a switch to Zenwalk, but following an Xubuntu install, that's over now.
