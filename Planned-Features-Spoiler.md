You can see the prewiew of some further SuperTux changes.

**Border slope tiles**![Border slope tiles prewiev](images/Border-slope.png "fig:Border slope tiles prewiev") In SuperTux 0.3.4 cliffs can end only on flat tiles to tile them well. There will be slope tiles, that can be placed on the end of a cliff.

**New ghostwood tiles**![The only supported ghostwood texture prewiev](images/Ghostwood.png "fig:The only supported ghostwood texture prewiev") The ghostwood tiles will be retextured. All ghostwood tiles will use similar textures. Many missing tiles will be added.

**New signs**![New signs prewiev](images/Signs.png "fig:New signs prewiev") The run signs will no longer contain snow on the top to fit the forest theme. There will be also three new color signs, a sign that suggest waiting for a platform to avoid suicides at those places and a sign that suggests carrying a lantern.
