Border slope tiles
------------------

In SuperTux 0.3.4 cliffs can end only on flat tiles to tile them well.
There will be slope tiles, that can be placed on the end of a cliff.

New ghostwood tiles

similar textures. Many missing tiles will be added.

New signs
---------

The run signs will no longer contain snow on the top to fit the forest
theme. There will be also three new color signs, a sign that suggest
waiting for a platform to avoid suicides at those places and a sign
that suggests carrying a lantern.
