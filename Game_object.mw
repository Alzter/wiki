== GameObject ==

[[Image:gameobjects2.png|thumb|A diagram illustrating the planned design for the GameObjects]]

This is the most basic class for objects in the game. Nearly everything should inherit from this class. All GameObjects are stored in a list by the engine.
This list will be traversed 2 times per frame. First the action function is called on each object, and then the draw function of each object is called.

The class also contains a flag that indicates if the object should be removed at the end of the frame. You can call remove_me() to set this flag.





== InteractiveObject ==

These are objects you can interact with. The objects will have an area in the world. And you can send interaction events to them. Typical interaction events will be activate/push, ~EnterArea/touch, ~LeaveArea, hit with object

== MovingObject ==

This class provides a position and functions for collision detection. All Moving objects are held in a separate list by the engine which is also traveled once (between action and draw calls) for collision detection.
