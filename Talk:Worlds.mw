Most of these proposed worlds have already been done in at least one Super Mario game. Let's try to come up with something that hasn't been done this many times before.
I'd like an industrial/tech themed world, though.

IIRC, I saw a tech themed world on one of the Marios for the Gameboy.  A tech themed world would be great as sort of a Star World graphics trigger for those of us that misses the BSODs of classic SuperTux.  I don't think we will be able to really think up of anything that hasn't been done by Mario and still fits with the natural setting of SuperTux, simply because the SMB guys have had 20 years and who-knows-how-many games to come up with original worlds.  Doesn't mean we can't try. ;-)
