This page describes the new versioning scheme that will be used for SuperTux.

==The new scheme==

Releases will have the form of <tt>x.y.z</tt>.

* <tt>x</tt> is increased only when there is a <em>major</em> update. When <tt>x</tt> is increased, <tt>y</tt> and <tt>z</tt> are reset to <tt>0</tt>
* <tt>y</tt> is increased for each new regular, planned released. When <tt>y</tt> is increased, <tt>z</tt> is reset to <tt>0</tt>. Odd versions of <tt>y</tt> indicate a development branch. Even versions of <tt>y</tt> indicate a stable  branch.
* <tt>z</tt> is increased when there is a bugfix release or minor changes are made, such as a couple new features and new content (eg, new worlds or levels). For development branches, bigger changes are more likely to make it into <tt>z</tt>-releases.

The development branches are used to work our way to a stable release. For example, the <tt>0.3.x</tt> will be used to create a stable <tt>0.4.0</tt> ([[Milestone 2]]) release.

While development releases are likely to be stable, they are more liklely to receive less testing before a release, so we cannot guarantee their stability.

==Releases==

===<tt>0.1.x</tt> releases===

This is the [[Milestone 1]] branch.

The <tt>0.1.x</tt> releases do not follow the current versioning scheme. <tt>0.1.x</tt> is considered a <em>stable  branch</em>.

===<tt>0.2.x</tt> releases===

There will not be any <tt>0.2.x</tt> releases.

===<tt>0.3.x</tt> releases===

The <tt>0.3.x</tt> branch will be used to develop SuperTux 0.4.0. Its current aim is to implement the [[Milestone 1.9]] goals.

===<tt>0.4.x</tt> releases===

SuperTux 0.4.0 will be the [[Milestone 2]] release.
