Needs openAL.dll...
:Yes, as it says that on the [[Download/Installation_Milestone_1.9|download]] page... --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]]

== SuSE 9.2... It doesney werk cap'n! ==

The autopackage is linked to a glibc that's too new...
Fine, think I, I'll compile it.
So, first, physfs... fine, downloaded, compiled, installed.
Then jam, that compiled fine, and compiled supertux (what's wrong with make?)


but

supertux segfaults

recompiled with debugging and this is the complete output.

: You're missing a file. Unless, of course, it's there, in which case, SuperTux is just acting dumb. What version of Glibc are you using? I'm recompiling SuperTux Mi1.9 for Glibc2.3 for a Slackware-based live CD, and if you'd like, I can send you an RPM. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 13:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

GNU C Library stable release version 2.3.3 (20040917), by Roland McGrath et al.

If you could, it'd be great. Thanks. (The only file I see it missing is "config" but as it says "using default settings" I don't see why it would cause problems)

My e-mail address is (remove the spurious fullstops... I loath spam and I know what spembots are like these days)

: Darn, I'm having trouble getting the development libraries to compile. It'll probably take a while to get finished, but you're using the right version of Glibc. I'll email you the RPM when I'm done... Assuming Gmail lets it through because of the size...

:: Autopackage's glibc too new? Are you sure? (The point of AP is working around that problem) Which autopackage do you use? Did you get any error message?
