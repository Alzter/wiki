Needs openAL.dll...
:Yes, as it says that on the [[Download/Installation_Milestone_1.9|download]] page... --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]]

== SuSE 9.2... It doesney werk cap'n! ==

The autopackage is linked to a glibc that's too new...
Fine, think I, I'll compile it.
So, first, physfs... fine, downloaded, compiled, installed.
Then jam, that compiled fine, and compiled supertux (what's wrong with make?)


but

supertux segfaults

recompiled with debugging and this is the complete output.

: You're missing a file. Unless, of course, it's there, in which case, SuperTux is just acting dumb. What version of Glibc are you using? I'm recompiling SuperTux Mi1.9 for Glibc2.3 for a Slackware-based live CD, and if you'd like, I can send you an RPM. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 13:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
