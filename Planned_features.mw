===Code Tasks===
* separate lisp reader, tinygettext and other libraries properly out of SuperTux

===Editor / Developer Conveniences===
* optimize the build process, building SuperTux currently takes ages (I don't see how we could speed it up..., MatzeB)

===Levels / Scripting / Gameplay===
* fix console command set_game_speed() so that it doesn't slow down the console
* replace "you found a secret area" with a special sound (Wansti)
**why I like it the way it is. -ctdabomb
* General: Do something about the walking speed, feels wrong at the moment, maybe a bit slower
===Other===
* create SuperTux .xo Activity for OLPC (Grumbel)
* Have particle throwing starting enemies (fireflower like)
* add sprite scaling
