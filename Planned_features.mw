== Further releases ==
=== Code Tasks ===
* properly GPL'ify the supertux-editor (COPYING file, GPL headers, etc.)

=== Sound and Music Tasks ===
* Improve the sounds
* Compress music more. The 40 MBytes of music make up two thirds of the source tarball.

=== Graphics / Sprites ===
* Create SuperTux idle animations (<del>stage1: blinking with the eye,</del> stage2: tipping with the food, stage3: scratching the head)
** <small>I've added the code for idle animations, we just need the graphics now. The blinking animation already exists, but it needs some tweaking - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 06:25, 16 June 2008 (UTC)</small>
** [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=681]
* when Tux dies he can fly behind blocks instead of in front of them, drawing order bug
* Tux isn't centered properly to his collision box
* repair jump Tux sprite (to dark black) (Grumbel)
* do a 32x32 top-down water animation for the worldmap
** use these tiles [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=852]
* finish [[cannon]] graphics, also snowball graphics, death, etc (Grumbel)
* [[Snowman]] graphics (death animation, turn-around graphics) (Grumbel)
* [[Owl]] graphics (basically placeholder graphics right now) <small>—[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:53, 9 March 2010 (UTC)</small>
* some decor for ice tiles, cracks and stuff (Grumbel)
* finish icecrusher graphics
* deep snow tiles
** [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=911]
* icicle graphics for decoration purpose
** [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=911] an okay job, but not the best -CT.da'Bomb
* think of a new way to represent the exit area (snow molted with smooth ground below or so)
* add turn-around animation for smart-snowball

=== Editor / Developer Conveniences ===

*# directly accessible powerups
* finish editor improvements (MatzeB)
* editor doesn't align [[Cannon]] and [[Krush and Krosh]] properly (grid is wrong)
** I think it's using the 0,0-position of the ''image'' to align objects, not the ''hitbox''. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:50, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

=== Meta / Organization ===
* create a timeline what shall be done and when — [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Timeline]]
* discuss in the meetings what shall be done over the coming week — [[Next Meeting Agenda]]

=== Menu System / Game Configuration ===
* add gamma control to the option menu, see: int SDL_SetGamma (float redgamma, float greengamma, float bluegamma);
* make aspect ratio option menu thing work
* need to properly auto-detect and set aspect ratio on games first startup (i.e. on a 1280x1024 screen aspect must be set to 5:4, not 4:3)
* option menu entries are currently not in sync with gameconfig
* add scale-with-window option to magnification or something like that
* make left/right change an option in the menu, let enter apply it (needed for fullscreen)

=== Levels / Scripting / Gameplay ===
* level startup needs a fade-in, so does game startup, level abort and a few other places
* add all fade-in/out effects to DisplayEffect
* camera vertical scroll doesn't work properly in a small window (i.e. it doesn't move at all)

=== Other ===
* aspect ratio init code (Grumbel)
* think about peeking in relation to large screen size
** <small>Maybe disable peeking if the resolution is at a certain size or greater? Tux would just be centered. [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 18:34, 30 April 2009 (UTC)</small>

=== Enemies ===
* fix and cleanup all the enemy names - see [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Enemies]] for new names
** A beginning has been made by renaming ''Kamikaze Snowball'' to [[Snowshot]]. There's not much consensus about the other changes though, see [[Meeting 2010-02-27]]. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:01, 5 March 2010 (UTC)
* AngryBonusBlock: Have a bonus block type that comes to life when tux jumps against it and then chases Tux
:Break the "only good stuff from bonus blocks" and "same look same behaviour" rules? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 01:27, 25 May 2008 (UTC)
::Secret Maryo has a poisonous mushroom... if they break the rules, why not us? Also, bonus blocks already have varied behaviors. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 04:23, 7 September 2008 (UTC)
* create an enemy type that doesn't just walk straight into one direction, but does something different depending on Tux direction (ninja)
** <small>Is this a dupe of the Crystallo proposal for week 4? - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 19:58, 15 May 2008 (UTC)</small>
*** <small>No, this enemy is intelligent (reacts to Tux) --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 20:43, 19 March 2010 (UTC) </small>
* [[Mr. Bomb]]: let the fuse burn after one touched it
* [[Flying Snowball]]: Remove randomness, should be periodic and predictable
* [[Flying Snowball]]: Change timings to match that of Milestone1
* [[Flying Snowball]]: smoke effect for the motor seem to be to seldomly triggered

== Milestone 3 ==

These are items that can be postponed until milestone 3, but are still welcome for milestone 2.

===Code Tasks===
* separate lisp reader, tinygettext and other libraries properly out of SuperTux

===Editor / Developer Conveniences===
* optimize the build process, building SuperTux currently takes ages (I don't see how we could speed it up..., MatzeB)

===Levels / Scripting / Gameplay===
* fix console command set_game_speed() so that it doesn't slow down the console
* replace "you found a secret area" with a special sound (Wansti)
**why I like it the way it is. -ctdabomb
* General: Do something about the walking speed, feels wrong at the moment, maybe a bit slower
===Other===
* create SuperTux .xo Activity for OLPC (Grumbel)
* Have particle throwing starting enemies (fireflower like)
* add sprite scaling
