I have noticed that the help page is the most heavily spammed page in the wiki. Admins, could you please protect the page to prevent further vandalism? Note: revert to one of my edits (FlyingPenguins), and only my edits, '''then''' protect. Some spammers have hidden web links in the edit text, and we don't want that to appear while that page is protected. -[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 07:28, 26 Nov 2005 (CET)
: Thanks for the advice. I protected the page and made you a sysop, so feel free to use the 'block' and 'rollback' features aggressively :) - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 22:58, 30 Nov 2005 (CET)

Oh great. Now ''this'' page is a spam magnet. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 07:19, 2 Dec 2005 (CET)
