Welcome to the SuperTux Tutorial!

== SuperTux Basics ==

SuperTux is a classic-style jump-'n'-run first-person platformer where Tux, the Linux mascot, must save his girlfriend Penny from his arch-rival, Nolok, by squishing baddies and collecting coins in the snowy lands of Antarctica. The primary objective is to finish each level by getting to the goal. This usually unlocks even more levels for you to try!
