Below you can find a list of ideas that have already been discussion and have rejected, arguments for rejections should be included when available:

==No Beastie==

We won't include Beastie or any other FOSS mascot. SuperTux is meant as a good jump'n run, not as a showcase of walking FOSS logos. The use of Tux is because he makes a good starting point, one that other people can agree on, to create a world around him and less because he is the Linux mascot.

==No useless items/actions/enemies==

Any enemy, action or item added to the game should serve a specific purpose, thus allow something not doable by other items, enemies or actions. Different looking actions that serve the same purpose are most of the time just confusing and add unnecesarry bloat to the game. There is of course a little need to have a varity of enemies, but even with them varity in behaviour is much more important then varity in look. Different looking enemies might make pretty screenshots, but different behaviour makes a better game.
