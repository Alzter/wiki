What do you think - is "Igel" ok for you? 

Vote yes or no. You might want to give an alternative in either case. Don't forget to state your (nick-)name for further discussion.

* yes / Mr. Igel, Mr. Hedgehog, Haggles / Christoph
* yes / Who cares about the name? Players don't see them anyway. So the inventor gets to name his badguy as he likes. IMO a real name is much better for developer discussions than just badguy001, badguy002, ...
*yes / Igel. I care about the names, but I think Igel is a very good name for this bad guy - who I like alot / gwater
* no / It sounds pretty weird; makes me think of "angel"; not too descriptive. (Yukaili)
* yes / Very creative name, despite the fact that most people (like me) won't know what an igel would actually be. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]]
* no / I don't like it...I think that hedgehog would be better--but it doesn't ''really'' matter, as person #2 says. --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 15:30, 2 June 2009 (UTC)
:: (Note: This isn't about the name, but I don't think it should be so hard to kill. Its difficulty for newbies seems out of place...just saying.)
