What do you think - is "Igel" ok for you? 

Vote yes or no. You might want to give an alternative in either case. Don't forget to state your (nick-)name for further discussion.

* yes / Mr. Igel, Mr. Hedgehog, Haggles / Christoph
* yes / Who cares about the name? Players don't see them anyway. So the inventor gets to name his badguy as he likes. IMO a real name is much better for developer discussions than just badguy001, badguy002, ...
