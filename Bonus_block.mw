Hit this block with your head to get a bonus!

There a several types of bonus block:

[[Image:Bonus Block.jpeg]]

This is the most basic bonus block, giving Tux 1 coin when hit. In the game, all bonus blocks except crates, invisibles and used bonuses look like this. The images for Powerup blocks, invinsible blocks and 100 coin blocks are taken from the level editor of 0.1.3.

This Bonus Block has the appearance of a wooden crate. It allows Tux six coins, giving him one every time he hits it.

The same as the normal crate, but is used when the area is more snowy.

Gives Tux a powerup! If he is small, it releases an egg which slides across the ground in essentially the same pattern as Snowballs. The egg makes Tux big! If he is already big, a fireflower sprouts from the top of the block. It gives him firepower! In older versions, Tux turns red, but in version 0.3 he gets a little fireman's cap (careful - you lose this is you backflip) The more Fireflowers you get, the more rapidly you can fire.

This is really another type of powerup, but comes from a differnt block. It releases a fast, bouncy white star. If you can catch it, Tux gets all sparkly and is immune to badguys. In version 0.1.3, all badguys except flames are killed when Tux touches them. In 0.3, he can still jump on them and squish them if he likes, but if he walks into them they just get killed same as normal. He can also still make iceblocks shoot around, but they're killed if they hit him. Bombs explode, too, but it doesn't hurt Tux. Flames are still not hurt. It remains to be seen whether invinsible power kills badguys such as darts and cannons. (Note - when Tux reaches the End Sequence area, he becomes invinsible to badguys and goes all sparkly til he reaches the Final Goal.)

[[Image:Bonus Block - Invisible.jpeg]]

This is just like a normal block, but invisible until you hit it with your head. It then changes to look like an Empty bonus block.

[[Image:Bonus Block - 100 coins.jpeg]]

This block release a tiny penguin when hit. It goes up slightly at an angle away from the side Tux hits it on, then curves and goes down, to be lost forever unless Tux can catch it before it goes into the ground. In 0.1.3, he got a life if he caught it, but as lives are eliminated in 0.3, he gets 100 coins. This could be changed at a later date as he only loses about 25 when he dies.

[[Image:Bonus Block - Empty.jpeg]]

All bonus blocks look like this once empty, but there is also some which begin like this. It acts as a normal block.
