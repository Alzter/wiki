Hello, I´m the Norwegian Bokmål (Bokmaal) translator, and I´m not very familiar with programming or contributing. But I thought it was such a shame that there was someone working with Norwegian Nynorsk while Bokmål (the most used language here in Norway) had no contributor. So I thought "Hey, you are not a programmer, and is only 15 years old, but at least you know your own language". (Actually I think I am better in writing/speaking Norwegian Bokmål than many other at 15 years.)
So I took the Norwgian Nynorsk translation and changed a few things the languages don´t have in common, but I´m not finished yet.
