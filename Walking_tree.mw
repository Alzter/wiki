They look like a hollow treestump with eyes and feet, here are some things they could do.

# Walk and run over Tux
# Tux could jump inside and control them since they are hollow, Tux being invulnerable. However he can't jump except out of them
# There should maybe be rolling logs as well, and floating logs that can move around when jumped on or float down river... could be interesting to have waterfalls

Also, nonwalking trees in the background might shake their branches disturbing Tux and other creatures.

Behaviours and look: above

Hurt Tux: run over him

Hurt it: spit
