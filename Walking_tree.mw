Behavior and look: Walking trees look like hollow trees with eyes and feet. They should be 1.5x larger than [[Tux]].

# Walk and run over [[Tux]].
# [[Tux]] could jump inside the tree from under and control them since they're hollow, but only if Tux is invulnerable. However, he can't jump inside them, other than out of them.
# There might be rolling logs as well. Floating logs could also be useful when crossing a river/waterfall; Tux could control them if he jumped on them. 

Hurt [[Tux]]: Run over him. Also, normal trees in the background may shake their branches to disturb [[Tux]] and other creatures.
Also, nonwalking trees in the background might shake their branches disturbing Tux and other creatures.

Hurt the enemy: Jump onto it.
