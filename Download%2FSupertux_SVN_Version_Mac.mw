=Supertux SVN Version Mac=

===About:===

The SVN version of Supertux is also available for download for Leopard in an easy-to-use installer. Currently, The installer is not available, but the application is included. The Installer will be included in a later release. The version of supertux uses a program for macintosh intel only called Wine. It uses the intel chip to process windows applications. Don't worry, Wine is included within the file. There are easy steps.
1. Download.
2. Move to a suitable spot
3. Open!

In order for the application to run properly, you must have apple's X11. It comes usually with the "Optional Installs" disk that you got when you bought your mac.

===Editing===

If you want to port your levels/backgrounds to the game, you have to go to this directory: <code>/Users/(Your Username)/Library/Application Support/Wine/prefixes/Supertux 0.3.3b/drive_c/Program Files/SuperTux 0.3.3/data</code>
For a easy find, hit Command+Shift+G and copy and past that text in the code text I just gave you. You can even update the svn in that directory too. But editing the actual Application will not do anything unless you delete the library-based Supertux data folder. If you do that, the folder will get the contents of the application.

===Requirements===

To download the game you need the following items.
•Apple's X11
•Mac OSX 10.5 or later
•At least 350 Megabytes of hard drive space

===Updating the SVN===

Easy-Download from http://supertux.lethargik.org/svn/supertux/trunk/supertux with some sort of SVN downloader thingy. I use Tortoise SVN, so you can try that. Then, put the data folder in: "users/(Your Profile)/Library/Application Support/Wine/Prefixes/Supertux 0.3.3b" and replace. (I honestly don't know what the other folders do) Tip: Don't go through the whole process that often. maybe once every two-three weeks.

Thank you and enjoy! [[User:Monster|Monstertux]] 20:58, 13 April 2011 (UTC)
