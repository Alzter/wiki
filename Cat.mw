Hurt Tux: like Bouncy Snowball or Icicle

=== Proposed Variant ===

# When the Cat walks forward on the ground and is less than 3 tiles from a wall or less than 6 tiles from Tux, she will jump forward and fly through the air curled up as a ball. 
## When she hits Tux, he will get hurt. 
## When she hits a wall, she will start walking up the wall.
### she reaches a convex edge while climbing, she will jump upward, advancing some px on the apex and landing feet down on the edge.
### she approaches a concave edge while climbing, she will stop and wait for Tux to get behind her.
#### When Tux is less than 3 tiles behind her, the Cat will drop and hopefully land on Tux.
