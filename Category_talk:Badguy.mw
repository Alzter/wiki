== BG, a bit smarter than Poision Ivy ==

To put badguys eg. on a branch or a ledge i'd like to have a Forest World Bad Guy, about one tile in size, easy to be killed (squished, shot, whatever) but does not jump off his ledge.

Something like Poision Ivy but smart enough not to commit suicide. Maybe a autumn version of the walking leaf. Since it's more careful it might walk a bit slower. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 18:20, 26 Jul 2006 (BST)


== Flying Badguy ==

Today in #supertux there was the idea of some flying badguy that if killed just loses his ability to fly and becomes a walking BG. (Rip out his wings, pop his baloon, pull his goggles, etc.) A airborn BG that just flies left/right or even is stationary could be used to jump on to cross a river or as moving obstacle.
