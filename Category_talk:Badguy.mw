== BG, a bit smarter than Poision Ivy ==

To put badguys eg. on a branch or a ledge i'd like to have a Forest World Bad Guy, about one tile in size, easy to be killed (squished, shot, whatever) but does not jump off his ledge.

Something like Poision Ivy but smart enough not to commit suicide. Maybe a autumn version of the walking leaf. Since it's more carful it might walk a bit slower. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 18:20, 26 Jul 2006 (BST)
