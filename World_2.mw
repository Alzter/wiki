==Forest World End story==

Tux entered the Great Hall of Nolok's forest castle. He heard above him the noise of an engine, so Tux ran quickly upstairs to find that he was too late. Nolok had taken Penny into a helicopter which was now high in the air and dissapearing into the distance and heading out to sea. Tux went sadly downstairs and found another note. "Tux, you are far braver than I thought, but next time you will not be able to find me or your beloved Penny and give my regards to the (INSERT BOSS NAME HERE)."

Tux then remembered the map that Penny drew him, so Tux took the map out and was about to head off to Nolok's ocean fortress, when suddenly...

==The keys==

The 5 keys include this:
*A Silver key. (found behind a waterfall)
*A Golden key. (found in some dense trees)
*A Brass key. (found in water)
*A Bronze key. (found in a special hidden box)
*A Big Iron key. (possibly guarded by a mini-/boss)

Some kind of twinkle noise might be appropriate when he finds each one.



==New Engine Features==

* Falling Leaves particle system
* rising lava/water
* moving platforms (branches that move a bit up and down, or logs falling down a waterfall)
* support for cutscenes (done in a lisp file) in a level
* sound triggers in some areas (cuckoo or woodpecker sound in some part of the level)
* sound triggers when touching objects (ripple sound when walking on a steam)
* Rocks that you can carry around to reach higher places
* A bug enemy (or several sorts of bugs?)
* An ant enemy
* A branch enemy (a branch of a big tree that tries to beat tux, or simply moves up/down)
* uneven tiles so you can have some small hills
* Multiple sectors (ie. you can enter tree by walking into some holes)
* (We might experiment with some shadow effects that you get with moving branches?)
* bouncy branch, a branch that makes you bounce very high into the air.
