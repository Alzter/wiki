==The keys==

The 5 keys include this:
*A Silver key. (found behind a waterfall)
*A Golden key. (found in some dense trees)
*A Brass key. (found in water)
*A Bronze key. (found in a special hidden box)
*A Big Iron key. (possibly guarded by a mini-/boss)

Some kind of twinkle noise might be appropriate when he finds each one.



==New Engine Features==

* Falling Leaves particle system
* rising lava/water
* moving platforms (branches that move a bit up and down, or logs falling down a waterfall)
* support for cutscenes (done in a lisp file) in a level
* sound triggers in some areas (cuckoo or woodpecker sound in some part of the level)
* sound triggers when touching objects (ripple sound when walking on a steam)
* Rocks that you can carry around to reach higher places
* A bug enemy (or several sorts of bugs?)
* An ant enemy
* A branch enemy (a branch of a big tree that tries to beat tux, or simply moves up/down)
* uneven tiles so you can have some small hills
* Multiple sectors (ie. you can enter tree by walking into some holes)
* (We might experiment with some shadow effects that you get with moving branches?)
* bouncy branch, a branch that makes you bounce very high into the air.
