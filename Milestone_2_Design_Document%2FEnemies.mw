This page shall describe all enemies, old and new, in as much detail as possible. We also need to settle down on proper names for enemies, since currently there is a lot of confusion.

== Snowball / Sport Snowball ==

[[Image:SnowballSprite.png|right]]

Snowball is a straight forward falking enemy, when reaching an edge he will fall down and continue walking on the platform below. Jumping on him will squish him and thus kill him.

== Mrs Snowball / Stay-On-Platform Snowball / Smart Snowball ==

[[Image:SmartSnowballSprite.png|right]]

Mrs Snowball behaves like a normal snowball, but instead of walking of a platform she well turn around when reaching the edge.

== MrIceBlock ==

[[Image:MrIceblockSprite.png|right]]
Like Snowball MrIceBlock is a simple straight forward enemy, he will not stay on platforms. When jump on he will get knocked out and become a grabable item that one can use to throw at other enemies.
<br clear="all" />

== Crystallo ==

[[Image:Crystallo.png|right]]

Again a very basic enemy, but unlike the Snowball he doesn't walk around in a straight pattern, but walks forward and backward around a fixed position. It is a stationary enemy.

== SnowJumpy ==

[[Image:SnowJumpySprite.png|right]]
Replace it with something that better fits the snow world
<br clear="all" />

== Starfish ==

Star shall get replaced by a starfish. (does that even make a graphical difference?)

== Ice Fish == 

Already in the code, but not much used in Milestone1 Levels

== Owl ==
[[Image:Owl.png|thumbnail|right|Owl]]
A flying enemy that can land on trees and carry things around to throw at Tux.
<br clear="all" />

== Angry Iceblock ==
[[Image:Iceblock.png|thumbnail|right|Angry Stone]]

Like Angry Stone, but with iceworld theme.
<br clear="all" />

== Snow Canon ==
[[Image:Canon.png|thumbnail|right|Canon]]
The canon can be mounted on either static or rotatable pedestal. It shoots angry looking snowballs.

<br clear="all" />

== Mini Bomb ==
[[Image:Minibomb.png|thumbnail|right|Mini-Bomb]]
The Mini-Bomb is an small version of the normal bomb, it approaches in groups most of the time and is aggressive, it however is non-lethal to Tux and only works to either distract him and throw him back.
<br clear="all" />

== Spitter ==
[[Image:Spitter.png|thumbnail|right|Spitter]]
The spitter acts as walking dispenser, the enemy type that he can spit out might be limited to mini-bombs and similarly small enemies.
<br clear="all" />

== Yeti ==
[[Image:Yeti-concept.jpg|thumbnail|right|64px|Yeti]]
[[Image:Yetiapproach.png|thumbnail|left|Yeti Boss Cutscene]]

The Yeti is the boss that awaits Tux in the first castle. After entering the throne room Tux will find a letter in which Nolok tells Tux of the other castles in other worlds (see Milestone1 extro.txt). In the background there is a window. While reading the note one will see a shadow approaching the window and soon after the Yeti jumping through the window. The normal boss battle starts instantly after the jump.

The current Yeti pattern needs to be reworked, since it is to easy to just stand in a corner and do nothing.

Alternative: Sequence at end of castle: Tux find Yeti, Yeti jumps out of the window and  flees
<br clear="all" />

== Snowman ==
[[Image:Snowman-variations.png|thumbnail|right|Snowman]]

* a snowman enemy shall be added, a snowman is build out of a base body combined with a snowball head, if the body is destroyed, the snowman turns into a snowball (use bandana for canon)
* take the jogger one for fall-down snowball
* take the japanic one for the gun
* take teh "normal" one for stay on platform
* take the "ninja" for following tux

== Eater ==
[[Image:Eater.png|thumbnail|right|Eater]]
The Eater is a very small enemy, half the size of a snowball, he can however expand a lot. If Tux gets to close to him the Eater will open his mouth wide enough that he can devour Tux or even other badguys. He his not defeatable by jumping onto him, since he will then just eat Tux. Throwing stuff at him won't work either, since again he will just eat them.
