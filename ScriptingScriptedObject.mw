= Summary =

A ScriptedObject is basically a SuperTux object that can be scripted to move around and animate. You can created ScriptedObjects
by defining them in level files. Each scripted object will be exposed under its name to the scripting engine.

= Example =

Example of a definition:
 <pre>
  (scriptedobject
    (x 2291)
    (y 1275)
    (name "SUPERTUX")
    (sprite "images/creatures/tux_big/tux.sprite")
    (layer 100)
    (visible #t)
    (physic-enabled #t)
    (solid #t)
  ) 
 </pre>

The above object will be exposed under the name SUPERTUX in the scripting engine. Example usage:

 <pre>
  // This script will make tux look and walk left/right (this should make him appear
  //   "upset")
  SUPERTUX.set_action("stand-right");
  wait(2);
  SUPERTUX.set_velocity(200,0);
  wait(0.3);
  SUPERTUX.set_velocity(0,0);
  wait(0.4);
  SUPERTUX.set_action("stand-left");
  SUPERTUX.set_velocity(-200,0);
  wait(0.3);
 </pre>
