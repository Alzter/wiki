**The Forest** is the second world in SuperTux. It is generally a lively place with many creatures roaming about. Parts of the *Forest*, however, are corrupted.
This world is currently still under development but can already be accessed in story mode, and has been in the game for a while now. This world was included in the unstable *SuperTux 0.3*
It is currently one of the teams priorities for a future release.

### Levels

Rooted Forest is still under development and therefore it is not reasonable to state which levels exist. Many will be removed or changed.
