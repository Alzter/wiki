To get development speed up and back into motion we are currently trying the use of meetings via voice chat instead of just text, the first meeting so far was a success and we want to redo it again. This page is meant to document the required software and setup.

== Software ==

Three pieces are needed to participate fully in a meeting, one is Ekiga, a internet phone application, the other is netBrush, a multiplayer paint application and last not least a good old IRC client:

* http://ekiga.org/
* http://happypenguin.org/show?netBrush
* IRC client

=== Ekiga ===

To participate in a meeting you need an account at [http://www.ekiga.net Ekiga.net], other sip accounts don't seem to work with the conference server. Make sure that your soundcard and micrphone are working correctly (you can use Audacity for testing).

Once you have it installed and created yourself an account you can test it with the EchoTest, that you can call at:

* sip:500@ekiga.net

The conference itself will be done at:

* sip:501XXXX@ekiga.net

XXXX is the room number, which will be announced on IRC. Before participating in a meeting it is recommend that you try to use the conference server for yourself, some people had trouble connecting to it or understanding each other. It is a good idea to fix those issues before joining the official meeting.

More information along with more echo-test numbers can be found at [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ekiga#head-1af436e7351b009c0dacfa9d72a9c5e70eead25a Ubuntu Ekiga Doku].

=== netBrush ===

Using netbrush is relativly simple, its started with: 

./netbrush-client SERVER PORT

both SERVER and PORT are announced before the start of the meeting on IRC.

== Process ==

The meetings always start on IRC, when all people that want to participate are available the conference room number is chosen. The first meeting showed that making netbrush server and conference room number available to the public isn't a good idea, since it makes it hard to track down which user is having trouble with his setup, who is already in the room (Ekiga doesn't provide any info on that) and such. Also netbrush-server currently has trouble with people connecting late into a session. So to keep things stable, the room number isn't published on the public channel, but /msg'ed to everyone that wants to participate one by one, making sure that their setup is working.

== Alternatives ==

There seems to be one viable alternative to Ekiga and that is mumble, its simpler in that it doesn't require an account and is specifically designed for multiple people talking at once. However quite a few people had trouble getting it to compile or fail to work properly with their soundcard, while Ekiga worked for most.
