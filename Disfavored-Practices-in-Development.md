This page is supposed to show some issues that occur too often currently during
development of the game. These issues should be fixed to make it possible to
develop more quickly and more effectively.

- Changing stuff without any discussion
- We need a better way of knowing who works on what
  - Partly fixed by GitHub, management needs improvements though
- No real place to permanently store decisions and proposals for stuff
  - Fixed by [SuperTux/meetings](https://github.com/supertux/meetings)?
- Discussion over tiny details. Rather let someone work on it and then ask them
  to improve their stuff.
- Changelog is not updated before a release. This makes it hard to know what
  exactly changed in a release, when publishing a new one.
- Code is not commented enough. Especially in physics and drawing code, some
  constants are not explained at all.
- No use of translator comments
