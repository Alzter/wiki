there is a tux port for the openmoko linux phone project too

I downloaded supertux with apt-get in ubuntu. Which is the executable, and where is it?
: The executable is most probably called "supertux2", "supertux-stable" or "supertux" and should be located in /usr/games.

== svn ==

Where do you download the svn version?

:see [[Download/Subversion]] --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 19:52, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

I already looked at Download/Subversion. I can't find the install package.
:Yes, thats the idea of a source code repository. This is where the developers store the work in progress code. Either compile it yourself or wait until a new release is made. --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 20:50, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
