there is a tux port for the openmoko linux phone project too

I downloaded supertux with apt-get in ubuntu. Which is the executable, and where is it?
: The executable is most probably called "supertux2", "supertux-stable" or "supertux" and should be located in /usr/games.

== svn ==

Where do you download the svn version?
