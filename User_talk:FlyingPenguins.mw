- I just added spamblocklist plugin from wikipedia. The list is updated daily from http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spam_blacklist&action=raw I hope this is enough for now...--[[User:62.214.235.133|62.214.235.133]] 18:56, 13 Dec 2005 (CET)
*Thank you for helping! But will it work with MediaWiki version 1.4.0? Is there anything else I have to do to get this set up? --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 02:11, 14 Dec 2005 (CET)
* No it seems the spamblocklist was just slower updating than spammers grabbing new URLs :-/ So now I installed drastic measures, posting of external links is only allowed for SysOps... It's not really nice but the best option I can think of at the moment.--[[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]] 04:26, 15 Dec 2005 (CET)
