= Brainstorming of forest things... =

* big trees, bushes, mushrooms, moss
* birds like cuckoo, woodpecker, owl, crows, "normal birds" (either in background with sound or as enemy...)
* smaller streams and waterfalls
* rocks here and there
* falling leaves
* crawling enemies (bugs, ants, ant-hills, spiders)
* tree house
* deers, elks
* glades with fairies
