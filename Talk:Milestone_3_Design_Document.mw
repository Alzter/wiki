: Making saveslot selection the very first thing in the game (before the mainmenu pops up) might be a good idea --[[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]] 19:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
::Why? --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 22:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

: We could use small supertux levels instead of the main menu. So you could navigate through some doors to the game or install addons by grabbing and dropping boxes :) The only menu left would be the Escape/Pause menu where you can setup controls --[[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]] 19:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
::That's a fun idea :). This could be integrated/related to grumbel's Walrus shop. - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 21:06, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
:::There has been a "main menu"-style test level in data/levels/test/menutest.stl for some time now. It could be a starting point for further tests. --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 21:34, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

: Storryteller voice over for intro is not a good idea, as it's hard to find translators for that. So we should avoid spoken text as much as possible IMO.
:: Don't think that would be an issue at all, those who don't get translation, simply get english voice overs and translated sub-titles. Anyway, voice over are just a idea which one could try out, without a good speaker it wouldn't be much fun to begin with. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 20:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

: I really prefer a non-linear worldmap. I would vote against reusing the M1 worldmap.
:: Nothing wrong with adding a few additional paths to the M1 worldmap, but the current worldmap in SVN is simply a illogical mess with levels everywhere, except where they should be.  Some linearity is simply needed to give the player a reason to actually play the levels at all. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 20:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
:: I agree. I would say the one in subversion is even worse than M1. Having entire branch(es) that are totally useless (ie, doesn't help you complete the game) are, well... totally useless :). I think the levels should either be integrated into the island better (ie, have alternate paths to complete the game or paths to bonuses like SMB's mushroom hut, etc) or they should be moved into Bonus Islands. Perhaps we could do a bit of both. - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 21:06, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
:::So you play the levels because you have to, not for fun? --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 22:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
:::: Yes -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 23:42, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
:::Well, then lets make that branches useful instead of removing them all. I think it would be a good idea to have Tux going back from a world to another. For example, in the forest world could be a branch to a Walrus shop or Bonus Level that you cannot access if you didn't get some item in a branch of the ice world. But I like the fact that, for example, you get he choice to choose between 2 easy levels and 1 hard level to get to the same point. If you get stuck in the hard level, instead of getting frustrated, you can skip it and try the easy ones. You can always go back and try to beat the hard one once you have got more experience. --[[User:Ferk|Ferk]] 17:45, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

: I don't understand why it says "bottom-less pits shall be either replaced by pits with spike at the bottom or allow Tux to climb back out of the pit." The only difference if Tux falls into a pit with spikes at the bottom versus a bottomless pit is that it takes him longer to die. The pits with spikes in the forest world are much more annoying than the bottomless pits because you have to sit there and watch Tux slowly die without being able to do anything about it. I'd prefer to keep it as is with having bottomless pits. [[User:Cooljeanius|Cooljeanius]] 20:47, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
::What about instant kill spikes? Something like lava but with a texture that fits in ice/forest. --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 22:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
:: The idea behind this is to have pits that don't kill you, but instead simply slow you down. If you didn't make the jump, just climb out and try again. It also gives the world a more 'complete' look, if you don't have holes all over the place. The spikes, which indeed should kill instantly, should only be used in those rare cases where you explicitly want to make a level extra hard (i.e. boss castle).

: Mailing list often overrun by non-development people, making it hard to discuss core game features - (from document)
:: One option is to use the bugtracker to discuss these features and set the ticket as "private" so that only developers can see it. This might be abuse of the tracker, depending on the issue being discussed, but it would certainly work. Alternatively I could set up a list that only developers can post to and even view(?). - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 20:52, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
::Mailing list is better. The bugtracker is complex enough already. For mails you don't even have to be online. --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 22:51, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
:: Of course the bug tracker is complex.  In fact, it's even an intended misuse of it.  There's a reason why they are called "issues", not "bugs".  My vote would be too just throw out the Mailing List entirely.  And what's this "you don't have to be online for email"?  You have to be online to do stuff on the internet. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 15:27, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

== Brainstorming of forest things... ==

* big trees, bushes, mushrooms, moss
* birds like cuckoo, woodpecker, owl, crows, "normal birds" (either in background with sound or as enemy...)
* smaller streams and waterfalls
* rocks here and there
* falling leaves
* crawling enemies (bugs, ants, ant-hills, spiders)
* tree house
* deers, elks
* glades with fairies

== Suggested world names for World 2 ==

Ice Forest, Ageless Forest, Dead Forest, Fiendish Forest, Nolok's Forest, Forest of Magic, Frosty Forest, Magic Forest, Freaky Forest, Snowless Forest, Icy Woods, Tuxedo Timberlands, Woody Forest, Wormy Woods, Windy Woodlands, Winter Woodlands, Impregnable Forest, Silvaniveus (forest + snow in Latin), Enchanted Forest, Timber! Tux (watch out for the loggers!)

More stuff to build alliterations from:

Fable, Familiar, Fairy, Fateful, Forked, Fallow, Fancy, Fantasy, Fearless, Fetid, Fleeting, Folly, Former, Frail, Fretful, Friendly, Furrowed, Forest, Fields, Fallow, Fringe, Fang

==New Engine Features==

* Falling Leaves particle system
* rising lava/water
* moving platforms (branches that move a bit up and down, or logs falling down a waterfall)
* support for cutscenes (done in a lisp file) in a level
* sound triggers in some areas (cuckoo or woodpecker sound in some part of the level)
* sound triggers when touching objects (ripple sound when walking on a steam)
* Rocks that you can carry around to reach higher places
* A bug enemy (or several sorts of bugs?)
* An ant enemy
* A branch enemy (a branch of a big tree that tries to beat tux, or simply moves up/down)
* uneven tiles so you can have some small hills
* Multiple sectors (ie. you can enter tree by walking into some holes)
* (We might experiment with some shadow effects that you get with moving branches?)
* bouncy branch, a branch that makes you bounce very high into the air.



=== Concept art ===

== Ladders ==

Another problem with climbing as GameObject instead of tile attribute is that now tiles that look the same can behave completely different.
Sooner or later there will be levels with surprises like "oh you have to climb THAT in here" and "AAAAAAAAAAAH, you can no longer climb this
convenient tiles above the lava".

== Editor ==

The items: "editor needs a minimap, like Flexlay" and "editor needs a grid, like Flexlay":
:Both must be possible to enable/disable. Also don't think they are really high priority.
