: Making saveslot selection the very first thing in the game (before the mainmenu pops up) might be a good idea --[[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]] 19:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
: We could use small supertux levels instead of the main menu. So you could navigate through some doors to the game or install addons by grabbing and dropping boxes :) The only menu left would be the Escape/Pause menu where you can setup controls --[[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]] 19:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

: Storryteller voice over for intro is not a good idea, as it's hard to find translators for that. So we should avoid spoken text as much as possible IMO.

: I really prefer a non-linear worldmap. I would not vote against reusing the M1 worldmap.

== Brainstorming of forest things... ==

* big trees, bushes, mushrooms, moss
* birds like cuckoo, woodpecker, owl, crows, "normal birds" (either in background with sound or as enemy...)
* smaller streams and waterfalls
* rocks here and there
* falling leaves
* crawling enemies (bugs, ants, ant-hills, spiders)
* tree house
* deers, elks
* glades with fairies

== Suggested world names for World 2 ==

Ice Forest, Ageless Forest, Dead Forest, Fiendish Forest, Nolok's Forest, Forest of Magic, Frosty Forest, Magic Forest, Freaky Forest, Snowless Forest, Icy Woods, Tuxedo Timberlands, Woody Forest, Wormy Woods, Windy Woodlands, Winter Woodlands, Impregnable Forest, Silvaniveus (forest + snow in Latin), Enchanted Forest, Timber! Tux (watch out for the loggers!)

More stuff to build alliterations from:

Fable, Familiar, Fairy, Fateful, Forked, Fallow, Fancy, Fantasy, Fearless, Fetid, Fleeting, Folly, Former, Frail, Fretful, Friendly, Furrowed, Forest, Fields, Fallow, Fringe, Fang

==New Engine Features==

* Falling Leaves particle system
* rising lava/water
* moving platforms (branches that move a bit up and down, or logs falling down a waterfall)
* support for cutscenes (done in a lisp file) in a level
* sound triggers in some areas (cuckoo or woodpecker sound in some part of the level)
* sound triggers when touching objects (ripple sound when walking on a steam)
* Rocks that you can carry around to reach higher places
* A bug enemy (or several sorts of bugs?)
* An ant enemy
* A branch enemy (a branch of a big tree that tries to beat tux, or simply moves up/down)
* uneven tiles so you can have some small hills
* Multiple sectors (ie. you can enter tree by walking into some holes)
* (We might experiment with some shadow effects that you get with moving branches?)
* bouncy branch, a branch that makes you bounce very high into the air.
