Walking Totem Poles could be especially interesting, as they generally have many faces...
Perhaps as Tux jumps on them it breaks apart into smaller totems each with a different face.

This or a big Walking Tree could be used as a Boss.

Behaviour: Walks, might spit electricity or fire

Look: A multifaced Totem Pole

Hurt Tux: spitting, run over Tux

Hurt it: jump at it to break into smaller Totems which can be jumped on or spat at.

== Comments ==

* It could be interesting to have the Walking Totem only loose its topmost face when Tux jumps on it

* Yeah, and it would be even better if Tux has to butt-jump.

* that would be very hard!

* the walking tree looks so good, better than a coming-from-nowhere totem!

* The Walking Totem looses only its topmost face when Tux jumps NORMAL on it, and it looses more faces when Tux butt-jump on it
