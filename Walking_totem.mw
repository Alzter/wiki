Walking Totem Poles could be especially interesting, as they generally have many faces...
Perhaps as Tux jumps on them it breaks apart into smaller totems each with a different face.

This or a big Walking Tree could be used as a Boss.

Behaviour: Walks, might spit electricity or fire

Look: A multifaced Totem Pole

Hurt Tux: spitting, run over Tux

Hurt it: jump at it to break into smaller Totems which can be jumped on or spat at.

* It could be interesting to have the Walking Totem only loose its topmost face when Tux jumps on it
