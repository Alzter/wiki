'''Mrs. Snowball''' is a [[badguy]] found in [[Icy Island]]. In contrast to (Mr.)&nbsp;[[Snowball]] she will stay on platforms rather than falling down. [[Tux]] can easily handle these “badgals” by jumping on them, squishing them in the process.

This badguy is planned for version&nbsp;0.4. It is in SVN since revision 5321.
