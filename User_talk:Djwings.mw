:Wow... Thanks. But it only looks that way. I'm not a hero or anything. I'm not even really part of the dev team. I just contribute from time to time to make it look like I'm doing something and convince myself that I'm part of something important. As for what I've done, check out [[Special:Contributions/Djwings]] --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]]: N0 PH33R 16:10, 10 October 2007 (UTC)
