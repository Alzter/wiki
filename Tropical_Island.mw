{{Proposed}}

Tropical Island is a proposed world/island that could be the third world of SuperTux. It might have enemies such as Mr. Palm Tree, Nutty, and others. It has also been suggested that in this world players will mostly play as Penny.

Perhaps: after reaching Nolok's castle in the Ghost Forest, Tux has a boss battle (typical) and Nolok gets away again with Penny and escapes to the Tropical Island. Tux naturally runs after him. Nolok keeps Penny in a cage, but a wild animal (or something) frees her, and she tries to navigate around the island while Tux desperately searches for her.
