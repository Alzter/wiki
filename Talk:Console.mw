I have a different keyboard layout, is there a way to find out which key number is the tilde? (Using MS 1.9)
:I don't think the key numbers change.  The raw key codes are abstracted away by SDL and the kernel. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 02:11, 11 Nov 2006 (CET)
:In the MS 1.9 preview builds, the Console is deactivated by default. Once it is activated, you can change simply change the console key in the "Options > Setup Keyboard" menu. --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 10:29, 11 Nov 2006 (CET)
Where Is The SuperTux configuration file

:That depends on what operating system you use, on Linux it would be /home/yourusername/.supertux2/config, on Windows somewhere like c:\Documents and Settings\yourusername\.supertux2\config (if I recall correctly, I'm a Linux user :) ) --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 14:01, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

== where is the supertux config ==

hi i am a mac user and i have no idea where the config file is
im trying to access the console and there is no description of how to access it on a mac

:I suspect it may be in your home directory, under a hidden directory in it called .supertux2 or like on windows in some directory called something like "Application Data". However as I'm a Linux user I don't know exactly. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 00:03, 23 December 2007 (UTC)

---Thanks. i looked in the home directory with Finder showing hidden files and folders, but there is no directory called .supertux2. i am trying to access the console from Mac OS X. is there any way to do that without modifying the config file???
