== Discussion ==

# Project management
#* (Unstable) Release
#** Licenses of data files: Status of tracking down the original authors. 
# Gameplay
#* Feedback for the [[Yeti]] and [[Above the Arctic Skies]] levels.
#* Carrying objects
#** [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/6794925041b61bdc5a941a5640914188-supertux-carry.png Proposed behavior]
#** Small Tux should not be able to go through 1-tile tall tunnels when carrying stuff
#*** Requires extending the hitbox
#**** That would hurt Tux when walking under a hurting tile 1 unit off the ground, which is wrong - [[User:Mattmccutchen|Mattmccutchen]]
#** Should held items function as a shield? (They do in SMW3)
#** Prority? (I.e.: Should this go into the next release or is this something that can wait?)
# Source code
#* Move external libraries out of tree and require them on the system itself (distro support? Windows?)
#** tinygettext: [http://ohnopub.net/~ohnobinki/tmp/supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-required.patch supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-required.patch] or [http://ohnopub.net/~ohnobinki/tmp/supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-automagic.patch supertux-r6306-tinygettext-external-automagic.patch]
#* Split physics, drawing, etc. apart
#** Which design pattern to use?
#* Find some way to change object constants without recompiling (sprites, Yeti bounds, velocities of various things, …)
# Next meeting date and time

== Things to do ==

* Document the license of data files in a file named <code>AUTHORS</code> or <code>CONTRIBUTORS</code>. See also: [[Template:Bug|578]].
* Fix bugs / things you don't like
* Make certain game is fun
* Update wiki pages (clean up design documents)
* New levels
* Enemies (bombfish, snowman, ninja snowball, forest enemies such as owl/zeekling...)
** Boss levels need lots of work (tree boss is confusing, totem pole is a piece of #@%&$, all are way too easy if you just stand in a corner)
* Expand levels to 25 tiles tall (max resolution is now 1280x800)
* Make certain camera/levels allow playing reasonably at 640x480 (min resolution)
