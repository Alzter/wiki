You uploaded [[:Image:Frame1.png]]. It would be nice if you created a page that decribes how you meant this badguy to act. See [[Badguys]] for links to to such pages. Also a more descriptive name than "Frame1" would be nice next time. Maybe something like "Leaf sketch"? --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:52, 20 Jul 2006 (BST)
