'''Zeekling''' is a [[badguy]] found in the [[Forest]]. It flies left and right in a straight path, usually near the top of the level. When [[Tux]] is below it, will dive down to hit him. Tux can avoid being hit by hiding underneath platform and other solid blocks.

Should be removed from Forest World for now.
