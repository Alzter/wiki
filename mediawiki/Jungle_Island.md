[[Image:jungle-concept.png|thumb|right|Concept art for Jungle island]]
== Story ==
Tux will sail form [[Forest|Forest island]] to Jungle island to get Penny. Then Tux will pass trough some levels to a clearing, where is the Nolok's castle located. Tux will see Penny on the clearing quite far from the castle. She will stand on a platform. However, it won't be penny, but only a wooden dummy and the platform will send tux somewhere deep in the Jungle. Tux will pass about twenty levels to reach the clearing and the Nolok's castle. Then Tux will have to defeat the boss. Tux will arrive in the prison, but there won't be Penny, but only a letter. There will be written:<br>
::''Dear Tux, I know, you will rather go to the Lavaland now, because Nolok has token me here, but the Nolok's fifth castle is covered in a crystal cave, that has two entrances. One is the mountain on Jungle island and the other is hidden in Lavaland, so you would never find it. Go to the crystal cave first and caputure the castle. Nolok won't go to the castle. And then use the other crystal cave exit to arrive in Lavaland.<br>
::::-Penny''<br>
After Tux will read the letter, he will go outside the castle and then into the mountain to the [[World 4|crystal cave]].

== Badguys ==
Jungle island is very similar to [[Forest|Forest island]], so they can use the same badguys. Jungle island will use some of them more often, than are used in [[Forest|Forest island]]. There will be also some new badguys only for Jungle island.

=== Tumbleweed ===
[[Image:tumbleweed.png|right]]
Its graphics are implemented, but there is no sprite or badguy for them. It rolls along the floor, when Tux is on the left or on the right. When Tux is above or under, it stops rolling. It hurts on touch and it can't be squished. It's flameable and freezable.
<br clear=all>
=== Hanging ball ===
[[Image:hanging_ball.png|right]]
It could be a stone stalactite that fits the forest and jungle theme, but stone stalactite wouldn't break suddenly. It's a ball of dirt and stones hanging on a wine. When Tux walks under it, it would fall down. It hurts on touch. When it's hit by fireball, it falls down and when it's hit by iceball, it will freeze and it doesn't fall, when is Tux under it. It doesn't freeze enemies, like [[Stalactite]].
<br clear=all>
=== Swarm of flies ===
[[Image:swarm_of_flies.png|right]]
The swarm of flies won't be flameable or freezable. It wouldn't hit on touch immediately, it will last a while. It will fly dirrectly to Tux. When it crashes to a solid wall, it dies.
<br clear=all>
=== Jungle ivy ===
[[Image:jungle_ivy.png|right]]
Jungle ivy will behave the same as [[crystallo]], but leaf particles will appear on death.
<br clear=all>
=== Mr. slimy ===
[[Image:mr_slimy.png|right]]
Mr. slimy will be squishable, freezable, but not flameable. When Tux jumps on it, Tux will stick and he will move twice slower for five seconds. However, when it will be frozen first, this effect won't appear.
<br clear=all>
=== Root ===
[[Image:root.png|right]]
This root will grow up, when is Tux nearby and it will throw hurting stones to Tux. Root wouldn't hit on touch neither be solid. Only the stones will hurt Tux. Root will be flameable and freezable.
