{{Milestone 2}}
The Secret Area Trigger is used to mark secret areas, at the moment it fades a tilemap, writes a message to the screen, and adds to the number of secrets the player has found in a level, as well as marking the total number of secrets.

It is specified something like the following:
<code>
 (secretarea
   (width <width>)
   (height <height>)
   (x <top left corner's x coordinate>)
   (y <top left corner's x coordinate>)
   (fade-tilemap "<secret area tilemap cover>")
 )
</code>

Upon entering the secret area, the specified tilemap will be faded, "You found a secret area!" will be displayed, and the user will have one more found secret added to his statistics. Nothing is currently done when leaving a secret area.
