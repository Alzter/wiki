'''Billboards''' are in-game explanations of game mechanics, such as the [[Fireflower]] or reset points.

== Extra Items ==

Egg needs a new graphic, Fireflower/Iceflower -> ?

== Unstable tiles ==

Change [[unstable tile]]s to be have like one of those:
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22RH2auraFs#t=3m40s Crumbling ground in Giana Sisters DS]
** Blocks crumble until they disappear. Then the player falls through.
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_SqtR3xFpM#t=1m20s Donut Blocks in Super Mario World]
** Blocks fall down without crumbling first. The player can still jump off of them.
Since {{Revision|6492}}, either behavior is possible, depending on the actions available in the sprite. The exact behavior is documented on the [[Unstable tile]] page.

== Slope Tiles ==

Slope tiles should be integrated.

Make Tux skid around and harder to control

[[Image:Supertux-deepsnow.png|deepsnow]]

Slow Tux down, cause him to sink in half

'''Will be implemented later'''

Problem: We don't have good water behavior.

== Reset Points ==

There shall be no reset points in the game, instead it should be made sure that levels are small enough to not require them. 

== No Lives ==

There will be no lives and no punishment for death aside from having to restart the level, due to the lack of reset points there simply is no need for lives.

== Collectibles ==

The game shall provide some form of special collectibles per level (5 special coins, 5 pieces of a crystal or stuff like that). How many of those collectibles are found is displayed in a prominent manner, not just part of the statistics. The Tux-doll (ex-1up) could be recycled for this purpose.
