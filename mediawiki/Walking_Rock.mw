'''Walking Rock''' is a big rock, unharmed by spikes, fireballs, enemies and such, usable by Tux as a platform.

Some features might be:
* invincibility
* can be frozen/unfrozen
* hurts Tux and kills enemies on lateral contact and when falling on them (might kill Big Tux directly). (This is because Walking Rock is big, heavy and able to crush smaller creatures)
* carries Tux/enemies on its head
* falls down from cliffs like Snowballs
* walks over lava

:the walking rock could push Tux if he gets in his way and kill him if squished by a wall. That would be interesting.
