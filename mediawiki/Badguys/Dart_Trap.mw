The '''Dart trap''' is a [[badguy]] in form of a skull. In regular intervals it shoots darts out of its mouth. The darts fly in a straight line, hurt [[Tux]] and cannot be destroyed but must be avoided. The ''Dart trap'' is mostly found in castles in the [[Forest]] world. 

=== To be done ===

* clicking sound when dart hits the wall
