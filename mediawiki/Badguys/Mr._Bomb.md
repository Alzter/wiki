'''Mr. Bomb''' is a [[badguy]] that can be found in all [[worlds]] of ''SuperTux''. When Tux or another badguy hits him, he stops and begins ticking. After a few seconds, he explodes, hurting all creatures within range. The presence of other Mr. Bombs during explosion may cause a chain reaction of explosions. He also explodes if he is hit by one of Tux's fireballs, but if hit by an [[Iceflower|iceball]], he freezes without exploding.

Due to Grumbel's complaint that “Mr. Bomb is the ugliest badguy ever created”, user [[User:Poison Ivy|Poison Ivy]] created a concept image for a new look by combining features of [[Snowball]] and the old Mr.&nbsp;Bomb in Gimp. This approach was not accepted either.
