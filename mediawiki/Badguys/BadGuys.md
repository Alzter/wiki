== Bouncing_Snowball

* Name=Bouncing Snowball
* Image=Bouncingsnowball.png
* FoundIn=[[Icy Island]]
* Appearance=A [[Snowball]] with eyes but without feet.
* Behaviour=Jumps around. Jumping is affected by walls and other badguys.
* Squish=yes
* Buttjump=yes
* Freeze=no
* Burnable=yes
* FirstVersion=0.1

'''Bouncing Snowball''' is a [[badguy]] in [[Icy Island]]. He bounces around, occasionally hitting Tux or even other badguys. In version 0.1.3, he always bounces in the same direction, regardless of the angle of the surface that he hits. The bouncing action in 0.3 and above is more realistic.

== Cannon


* Name=Cannon (dispenser)
* Image=Dispenser rocket launcher.png
* FoundIn=[[Icy Island]], [[Forest]]
* Appearance=Differs, see below.
* Behaviour=Spawns new badguys at fixed or random intervals.
* Squish=yes
* Buttjump=yes
* Freeze=yes
* Burnable=yes
* FirstVersion=Milestone 2

A '''Cannon''' is a [[game object]] that spawns new [[badguy]]s. The interval in which badguys are spawned is either fixed or random. A cannon can be shot with either the [[fireflower]] (dies) or [[iceflower]] (stops it emitting new badguys). Whether or not the dispenser is squishable and butt-jumpable depends on the appearance: The ''trapdoor'' and ''rocket launcher'' types are immune to [[Tux]] standing or jumping on them, the ''cannon'' type can be broken this way.

It is also possible for the cannon to shoot inanimate, non-badguy objects (even other cannons.)

=== Appearance ===

There are three possible sprites for this object: Trapdoor, cannon and (in lack of a better word) rocket launcher. Please note that despite the name, ''rocket launcher'' is the preferred appearance, at least in [[Icy Island]] ([[Milestone 2]]).

* Appearance=A fish jumping out of water.
* Behaviour=Jumps up out of water regularly.
* Squish=no
* Buttjump=no
* Freeze=yes

'''Fish''' is a [[badguy]] that jumps out of water. When [[Tux]] has to cross the water he has to pay attention to the fish so he doesn't get caught.

=== Proposed changes ===

[[Template:Proposed]]

Maybe a different color can be used in the forest world than in the [[Icyisland]].

Also, possibly there should be a few different types of fish:

# Standard up-and-down movement
# Curving Jump landing in a different place, going back and forth
# Archer Fish
#* Stays below the surface of the water, but follows tux when he is on platforms above
#* Shoots high pressure water which can break blocks and knock Tux into water where the archer fish can get him
# Swordfish
#* Curving Jump following Tux and jumping higher when there is a chance to get Tux

* Behaviour=Walks around. When jumped on, it's stunned for a little while and its explosion sequence is triggered.
* Squish=yes
* Buttjump=yes
* Freeze=yes
* Burnable=yes
* FirstVersion=Milestone 2

'''Haywire''' is a [[badguy]] from the [[Milestone 2 Design Document]]. It is very similar to [[Mr. Bomb]]: When jumped upon, the explosion sequence is triggered. In contrast to ''Mr.&nbsp;Bomb'', ''Haywire'' will not lie still but ran around madly. [[Tux]] can stun ''Haywire'' for a short while by jumping on it again, but should try to get out of its reach. When it explodes, hurts [[Tux]] and other badguys nearby.

When shot with a [[Fireflower]], explodes immediately.

* FoundIn=[[Forest]]
* Appearance=Looks like a common hedgehog.
* Behaviour=Walks around. Stays on platforms.
* Squish=no
* Buttjump=no
* Freeze=yes
* Burnable=yes
* FirstVersion=

'''Igel''' is a [[badguy]] in the second world of ''SuperTux'', the [[Forest]]. Igel cannot be squished or [[buttjump]]ed due to its spines but they can be shot with a [[fireflower]] when facing [[Tux]].

The term "Igel" is German for "hedgehog", which is precisely why the ''Igel'' in the game look like hedgehogs.

=== Proposed behavior ===
:''Note: The behavior described below differs from the behavior currently implemented in the development version of ''SuperTux''.''

Although basically vulnerable to shots that hit the soft head, Igel will immediately curl up for some seconds as soon as being shot at, thus either absorbing or deflecting the shot.

Upon reaching a ledge or when [[Tux]] stands less than 5 tiles behind Igel, Igel will slowly turn around, facing the camera and thus exposing the only weakness: When hit by a bullet while facing the camera, Igel will flip over for some seconds and can be squished by jumping on the exposed belly.

* Behaviour=Clings to the ceiling until [[Tux]] is underneath. Then drops with unstoppable force.
* Squish=no
* Buttjump=no
* Freeze=no
* Burnable=no
* FirstVersion=Milestone 2

'''Krush''' and '''Krosh''' are [[badguy]]s found in [[Icy Island]]. They are usually found on ceilings. If Tux comes underneath one, it suddenly drops without warning. If Tux does not get out of the way fast, he is hurt. After they hit the ground, they slowly drift back up. On this "return trip," Tux may safely climb on top of them and hitch a ride.

Both "icecrushers" are available in [[SVN]], but only Krush is implemented in levels.

== Kugelblitz


* Name=Kugelblitz
* Image=Flying-0.png
* FoundIn=''n/a''
* Appearance=A ''ball lightning'' with sparks.
* Behaviour=Moves to the ground, then randomly to the left and right within a limited range.
* Squish=no
* Buttjump=no
* Freeze=no
* Burnable=no

:''This [[badguy]] has been removed from the [[Milestone 2]] branch in [[Template:Revision|6282]].''
'''Kugelblitz''' is a [[badguy]] not widely used in ''SuperTux'' yet. The ''Kugelblitz'' moves down to the ground and then randomly left and right within a limited range. After a couple of seconds it vanishes. Like the [[Flame]] it cannot be hurt but [[Tux]] has to avoid it if possible. “Kugelblitz” is German for “ball lightning”.

=== Design considerations ===

The ''Kugelblitz'' (German for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_lightning "ball lightning"]) falls from the sky without warning; as soon as it hits the ground, it starts moving back and forth randomly for about two or three seconds in a fixed range, then vanishes with a pop in a cloud of smoke. Explodes on contact which hurts Tux. Alternatively, instead of moving at a random pattern, it could also move between coins or badguys.

The Kugelblitz cannot be hurt, the player has to avoid its radius until it's gone. With the alternative version, Tux can collect all coins/destroy all badguys before the Kugelblitz lands to make it disappear at once. It looks like a yellowish glowing wheel with animations for falling (with glowing trail), rolling, exploding and vanishing in smoke. It can be used in Ghost Forest and Forest Castle settings.

If the Kugelblitz hits water it vanishes and all water tiles get electrified for a short period of time. During that time, contact with water causes Tux and badguys to get hurt.

(I chose the German name because it's one of the few words that actually sound cooler in German than in English, IMHO.)

= Variation1 =
The path of the kugelblitz could be led by looking at surrounding things. For example the kugelblitz could always go the nearest coin or enemy in a range of 3 tiles give that it would not need to change it's direction more than 45 degree or so. This would allow the following 2 situations:

[[Image:Kugelblitz2.jpg]]

The kugelblitz would go down and then go upwards along the 2 coins and finally killing the 2 spikies and disappearing as there is no object anymore it could move to.

[[Image:Kugelblitz1.jpg]]

The kugelblitz would come down and start moving in circles from coin to coin. You could stop this behaviour by collecting 1 of the coins at the right time.

= More Ideas =

* The kugelblitz could be attracted to spikes and if it hits them disappear. Like a lightning arrester.

The '''Mole''' is a [[badguy]] found in the [[Forest]]. He's usually underground, so that only his molehill can be seen. He throws out small rocks in random directions that can hurt [[Tux]]. From time to time, he peeks out which is the time in which Tux can squish him by jumping on him.

* Behaviour=Walks around. When jumped on once, it is activated and explodes after a short time, killing nearby badguys.
* Squish=yes
* Buttjump=yes
* Freeze=yes
* Burnable=yes
* FirstVersion=0.1

'''Mr. Bomb''' is a [[badguy]] that can be found in all [[worlds]] of ''SuperTux''. When Tux or another badguy hits him, he stops and begins ticking. After a few seconds, he explodes, hurting all creatures within range. The presence of other Mr. Bombs during explosion may cause a chain reaction of explosions. He also explodes if he is hit by one of Tux's fireballs, but if hit by an [[Iceflower|iceball]], he freezes without exploding.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

[[Image:Mrbomb-left-0.png|thumb|right|Old image of Mr. Bomb]]
Due to Grumbel's complaint that “Mr. Bomb is the ugliest badguy ever created”, user [[User:Poison Ivy|Poison Ivy]] created a concept image for a new look by combining features of [[Snowball]] and the old Mr.&nbsp;Bomb in Gimp. This approach was not accepted either.

== Mr._IceBlock


* Name=Mr. IceBlock
* Image=Mr iceblock.gif
* FoundIn=[[Icy Island]]
* Appearance=A cube of ice with eyes and legs.
* Behaviour=Walks around. When jumped on once, it becomes a kickable and portable block of ice.
* Squish=yes
* Buttjump=yes
* Freeze=no
* Burnable=yes
* FirstVersion=0.1

'''Mr. IceBlock''' is a [[badguy]] in [[Icy Island]] with moderately complex behavior. In his ordinary form, he works like an ordinary walking badguy, turning around upon reaching walls and falling off cliffs. In version 0.3 and above, he only walks off a cliff if there is something safe on which he can land.

When stomped on for the first time, Mr. IceBlock suddenly stops short. If he is not stomped again for the next few seconds, he returns back to normal. However, if he is stomped once more while squished, he suddenly skids rapidly in one direction, hurting all creatures that he hits. When skidding, he bounces off walls and falls off cliffs. If another creature (including Tux) can stomp on him while he is skidding, he stops short once more (and if he is stomped again, he begins skidding again, and so on.)

While squished, Mr. IceBlock can also be "kicked," if Tux runs up right against him, and "carried" with the Action button. If Tux carries him and lets go of Mr. IceBlock, he suddenly begins skidding in the direction Tux is facing. 

Continually squishing Mr. IceBlock will eventually kill him.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
=== Behavior in [[Milestone 1]] ===

[[Image:Mriceblock-left-2.png|thumb|right|Old image of Mr. IceBlock]]
If Mr. IceBlock is eliminated, Tux is awarded 100 points. If destroyed via repeated squishes, Tux can get up to 550 points.

When carrying Mr. IceBlock, Tux is granted a "get out of jail free" card: if he hits another, non-invincible badguy, both Mr. IceBlock and the other badguy are killed, leaving Tux unharmed. A minor glitch occurs: Mr. IceBlock is scored as 0 points.

* Appearance=A green snail with a purple helmet.
* Behaviour=Moves around, falling from platforms.
* Squish=yes
* Buttjump=yes
* Freeze=yes
* Burnable=yes
* FirstVersion=0.3

'''Snail''' or '''Slow Snail''' is a [[badguy]] found in the [[Forest]]. When jumped upon, flips over. When flipped over, further jumps on it will kick it around, hurting everything in its way. Dies when [[buttjump]]ed or after being squished for a number of times.

=== Design considerations ===

The ''Snow Snail'' should be an enhanced counterpart to [[Icy Island]]'s [[Mr. IceBlock]]. They currently share the same behaviour, i.e. Tux can jump on it to make it stop, carry it around and/or kick it to use it as a projectile. In addition to that, the Snow Snail could stop from time to time and excrete puddles of slime that cover the ground and disappear after a certain amount of time. Whenever Tux steps into such a puddle, his movement is slowed down and he cannot jump until he slowly worked his way out of the trap or the puddle disappears by itself.

The Snow Snail should move slower than Mr IceBlock and speed up whenever Tux is in its visible area, especially when he's trapped in a slime puddle.

Since the Snail is used in the forest world, the name might be changed to Slow Snail

* Proposed modified behaviour:
** When flipped over and bumped horizontally, the Snail will just flip back on its feet
** When flipped over and jumped on one end, the Snail will fly not only horizontally but also vertically
** When it hits a wall while flying it will turn back on its feet

:''This [[badguy]] has been removed from the [[Milestone 2]] branch in [[Template:Revision|6280]].''
'''Walking totem''' is a [[badguy]] that's not widely used. It may be used in [[Forest]] levels in the future, though.

There is some “stacking” and “carrying” code in the SVN repository, which is probably a preparation for the functionality described below. Currently, only one segment is implemented – layered totems squish the ones below them.

=== Design considerations ===

[[Template:Proposed]]

[[Image:Totem.jpg|right|Walking Totem]]

Walking Totem Poles could be especially interesting, as they generally have many faces...
Perhaps as Tux jumps on them it breaks apart into smaller totems each with a different face.

This or a big Walking Tree could be used as a Boss.

Behaviour: Walks, might spit electricity or fire

Look: A multifaced Totem Pole

Hurt Tux: spitting, run over Tux

Hurt it: jump at it to break into smaller Totems which can be jumped on or spat at.

=== Comments ===

* It could be interesting to have the Walking Totem only loose its topmost face when Tux jumps on it
* Yeah, and it would be even better if Tux has to butt-jump.
* that would be very hard!
* the walking tree looks so good, better than a coming-from-nowhere totem!
* The Walking Totem looses only its topmost face when Tux jumps NORMAL on it, and it looses more faces when Tux butt-jump on it
* maybe each face shoots, and when one is squashed, it will not shoot.

== Walking_tree


* Name=Walking tree
* Image=Walk-left-6.png
* FoundIn=[[Forest]]
* Appearance=A walking tree with eyes.
* Behaviour=Walks around. Stays on platforms.
* Squish=yes
* Buttjump=yes
* Freeze=yes
* Burnable=yes
* FirstVersion=0.3

'''Walking tree''' (sometimes also '''Mr. Tree''') is a [[badguy]] in the [[Forest]]. When jumped on by [[Tux]], breaks into two [[Poison Ivy]] and one [[Stumpy]].

=== Design considerations ===
:''This section may be outdated.''
[[Category:Outdated]]
 
Hurt [[Tux]] Option 1: Run over him.

Hurt [[Tux]] Option 2: Runs over him and throws harmful objects at him. Mr.tree starts throwing fire balls after being hit with a fire shot from Tux.

Hurt [[Tux]] Option 3: Mr.Tree throws (spawns) harmful leaf/hair clump creatures by pulling clumps from his head. These leaf/weed creatures attack Tux.

Hurt the enemy Option 1: Jump onto it.

Hurt the enemy Option 2: Knock down Mr.Tree by throwing a Snail shells at him. Snails creatures can be stunned and then thrown at the tree. If Mr.Tree is hit with fire the animation changes and Mr.tree starts throwing fire balls at Tux. It is not a good idea for the player to light trees on fire, it just makes Mr.Tree mad.

Additional and/or Future Gameplay Ideas: [[Tux]] could jump into the tree from under and control them since they're hollow, but only if Tux is invulnerable. However, he can't jump inside them, other than out of them.

Side Notes: normal trees in the background may shake their branches to disturb [[Tux]] and other creatures.
Also, nonwalking trees in the background might shake their branches disturbing Tux and other creatures.

There might be rolling logs as well. Floating logs could also be useful when crossing a river/waterfall; Tux could control them if he jumped on them.

=== Proposal for burning Mr. Tree ===
When Mt. Tree is hit by a fireball, it might be set on fire. A burning Mr Tree runs around, killing small enemies (like Poison Ivies) and setting on fire other Mr Trees and straw blocks. If a burning tree hits Mr Bomb, they both die (Mr Bomb explodes). After a while, Mr Tree's leaves will burn completely, reducing it to a normal Stumpy (or killing it).
A burning tree might be immune to fireballs.

=== Proposal for Spooky Mr Tree ===
In Ghost forest, Mr Tree could have no leaves and have a carved out, spooky face with jagged branches. In Milestone 0.3, Mr Tree releases one or two Poison Ivies when jumped on. Spooky Mr Tree could release bats or some such thing.

=== Proposal for Branches ===
Mr Tree could have a thin branch sticking out either side of him which Tux can stand on to be carried around. This could serve a purpose if there was something that badguys could walk through but Tux couldn't.

== Will-o-wisp


* Name=Will-o-wisp
* Image=Willowisp.png
* FoundIn=[[Forest]]
* Appearance=Small green patch of light
* Behaviour=Moves towards and follows [[Tux]].
* Squish=no
* Buttjump=no
* Freeze=no
* Burnable=no
* FirstVersion=

The '''Will-o-wisp''' is a mean little [[badguy]] found in the haunted regions of the [[Forest]]. When [[Tux]] comes close, it will start to follow him slowly. Once it reaches Tux, he will be teleported to another, possibly dangerous part of the level. If Tux manages to get out of reach of the ''Will-o-wisp'', it will stop following him.

== Zeekling

* Name=Zeekling
* Image=
* FoundIn=[[Forest]]
* Appearance=Purple, winged critter
* Behaviour=Flies left and right high above ground. Dives to hit [[Tux]].
* Squish=yes
* Buttjump=yes
* Freeze=no
* Burnable=yes
* FirstVersion=0.3

'''Zeekling''' is a [[badguy]] found in the [[Forest]]. It flies left and right in a straight path, usually near the top of the level. When [[Tux]] is below it, will dive down to hit him. Tux can avoid being hit by hiding underneath platform and other solid blocks.

Should be removed from Forest World for now.
