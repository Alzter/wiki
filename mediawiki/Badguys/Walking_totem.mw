'''Walking totem''' is a [[badguy]] that's not widely used. It may be used in [[Forest]] levels in the future, though.

There is some “stacking” and “carrying” code in the SVN repository, which is probably a preparation for the functionality described below. Currently, only one segment is implemented – layered totems squish the ones below them.

== Design considerations ==

[[Template:Proposed]]

[[Image:Totem.jpg|right|Walking Totem]]

Walking Totem Poles could be especially interesting, as they generally have many faces...
Perhaps as Tux jumps on them it breaks apart into smaller totems each with a different face.

This or a big Walking Tree could be used as a Boss.

Behaviour: Walks, might spit electricity or fire

Look: A multifaced Totem Pole

Hurt Tux: spitting, run over Tux

Hurt it: jump at it to break into smaller Totems which can be jumped on or spat at.

=== Comments ===

* It could be interesting to have the Walking Totem only loose its topmost face when Tux jumps on it
* Yeah, and it would be even better if Tux has to butt-jump.
* that would be very hard!
* the walking tree looks so good, better than a coming-from-nowhere totem!
* The Walking Totem looses only its topmost face when Tux jumps NORMAL on it, and it looses more faces when Tux butt-jump on it
* maybe each face shoots, and when one is squashed, it will not shoot.
