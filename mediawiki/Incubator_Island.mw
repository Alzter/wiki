**Incubator Island** is a [world](world "wikilink") of *SuperTux* where new / proposed levels are improved until they are ready to go into the main game. [Levels](Levels "wikilink") in the main game have to comply with our [level style guide](level_style_guide "wikilink"). Levels that are *supposed* to go onto one of the *bonus islands* do *not* go onto the *Incubator Island* – they should go on a bonus island directly.

Levels have to pass some basic tests before going into *Incubator Island*:

-   Has a license for the level been specified and is it compatible with *SuperTux*'s own license?
    <small>(*SuperTux* is released under the GPL version 3 or later)</small>
-   Has an author been specified?
-   Is the level completable?
-   Is every secret area and coin reachable?

If a level passes those tests, it may be added to the *Incubator Island* for general review. When it's ready, a level may be moved to the main game. If a level won't make it to the main game, such as if its main gameplay idea is not acceptable for the main game (ex.: the player must jump on invisible tiles to complete the level), it can be moved to one of the *bonus islands*.
