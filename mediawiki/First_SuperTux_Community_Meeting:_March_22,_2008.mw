    [2008-03-22 14:49:53] <WolfgangB> so some logs would be nice
    [2008-03-22 14:50:21] <hand> I'm ere
    [2008-03-22 14:50:33] <deeesseeee> i'm here but i'm not developing, just listening in
    [2008-03-22 14:50:38] <hand> same
    [2008-03-22 14:50:47] <hand> I may have to leave soon though
    [2008-03-22 14:50:54] <deeesseeee> me too
    [2008-03-22 14:51:09] <hand> so...
    [2008-03-22 14:51:24] <hand> Shall we start now, and let the late people feel left out?
    [2008-03-22 14:51:31] * mathnerd314 is logging, but doesn't know where to post logs
    [2008-03-22 14:51:41] <hand> pastebin.ca :D
    [2008-03-22 14:52:13] <mathnerd314> but that's sort of... temporary
    [2008-03-22 14:52:19] <deeesseeee> maybe wait 5-10 min/
    [2008-03-22 14:52:21] <deeesseeee> ?
    [2008-03-22 14:52:40] <mathnerd314> well, I was slightly late...
    [2008-03-22 14:53:23] <mathnerd314> So let's wait about 15 minutes.
    [2008-03-22 14:54:00] <hand> I was 30 minutes early :P
    [2008-03-22 14:54:07] <Grumbel-c26c> I suggest we just start
    [2008-03-22 14:54:18] <hand> Cause I miscalculated on the time zone thing
    [2008-03-22 14:54:24] <Grumbel-c26c> Anything special you want to talk about?
    [2008-03-22 14:54:35] <hand> with Daylight Saving Time
    [2008-03-22 14:54:42] * mathnerd314 brings up his list
    [2008-03-22 14:54:54] <mathnerd314> Let's talk about world 3.
    [2008-03-22 14:55:12] <WolfgangB> :-)
    [2008-03-22 14:55:49] <Grumbel-c26c> There isn't even a world 2
    [2008-03-22 14:57:12] <mathnerd314> The idea is to give antsy people who aren't on the team something to work on while the developers finish world 2,
    [2008-03-22 14:57:15] <Grumbel-c26c> Anyway, there is this http://www.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/supertux-wasteland.jpg
    [2008-03-22 14:57:21] <mathnerd314> without getting in the way.
    [2008-03-22 14:58:02] <Grumbel-c26c> world2 has been put away for now, focusing on polishing world1 again
    [2008-03-22 14:58:49] <mathnerd314> World 1 seems almost done, except for the worldmap and cutscenes.
    [2008-03-22 15:00:37] <Grumbel-c26c> it doesn't make any user of newer features, which is why its getting a overhault
    [2008-03-22 15:01:21] <mathnerd314> Ah. I wish I had the editor working, because I have some good ideas...
    [2008-03-22 15:01:57] <mathnerd314> Correction: I have some good ideas for the editor.
    [2008-03-22 15:02:35] <WolfgangB> -v
    [2008-03-22 15:03:51] <mathnerd314> Why doesn't anyone else have something to say?

    [2008-03-22 15:04:25] <ohnobinki> Are we still supposed to talk about "world 3"?
    [2008-03-22 15:04:46] <hand> I'm just here to watch and listen
    [2008-03-22 15:05:11] <WolfgangB> what is missing in the editor?
    [2008-03-22 15:06:34] <mathnerd314> I was thinking of having it work on my system first, but
    [2008-03-22 15:06:58] <mathnerd314> a) A tile tool where you can draw a polygon, indicate you are done, and the editor will make as close an approximation as it can.
    [2008-03-22 15:07:57] <hand> sounds fun
    [2008-03-22 15:08:41] <mathnerd314> I've filled up about 10 pages of graph paper just drawing some examples.
    [2008-03-22 15:10:06] <mathnerd314> One part is correcting edges - I was thinking about having a list of which tiles are allowed to be next to each other.
    [2008-03-22 15:10:25] <WolfgangB> like the magic brush?
    [2008-03-22 15:11:22] <mathnerd314> Yes, except the "brush" consists of all tiles that are allowed to be next to each other, as well as which aren't.
    [2008-03-22 15:11:37] <mathnerd314> It's applied every single time you change a tile.
    [2008-03-22 15:12:11] -->| normaldotcom (n=root@c-76-122-185-19.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has joined #supertux
    [2008-03-22 15:12:43] <mathnerd314> When you change a tile, the editor looks at the four next to it and changes those if they are incorrect.
    [2008-03-22 15:13:09] <mathnerd314> The process continues, until you have a valid tilemap.
    [2008-03-22 15:13:59] <hand> Wouldn't that get aggravating to someone who wants something, but the brush keeps giving them something else?
    [2008-03-22 15:14:23] <mathnerd314> The editor tries to change as few tiles as possible.
    [2008-03-22 15:14:28] <hand> ah
    [2008-03-22 15:15:17] |<-- deeesseeee has left freenode ("http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client")
    [2008-03-22 15:15:43] <mathnerd314> Essentially, this turns most decoration into one tile, for example the large buried fish needs just one click. 
    [2008-03-22 15:16:26] <mathnerd314> (Three, actually, because you need to select the category, select the tile, then perform the click)
    [2008-03-22 15:16:34] <hand> I haven't had much experience with the editor, myself.
    [2008-03-22 15:16:48] <hand> And Supertux isn't installed on this machine
    [2008-03-22 15:17:05] <hand> but yeah, I can see what you're getting at.
    [2008-03-22 15:17:52] <mathnerd314> I've had no experience with the editor either (at least, the C# one) because I can't run it. (Bug 246)
    [2008-03-22 15:19:22] <mathnerd314> That's about it for tilemaps and editors, except snapping and gluing.
    [2008-03-22 15:20:31] <mathnerd314> The editor could join edges and corners together of objects, allowing you to make perfect rows without any additional effort.
    [2008-03-22 15:21:16] <mathnerd314> The objects can also be snapped to the solid parts of the tilemap.
    [2008-03-22 15:23:17] <ohnobinki> I was wondering about one thing concerning the badguys: Penguins do eat fish, I think. In tuxracer, tux eats herring. But in supertux, the fish only hurt tux.
    [2008-03-22 15:23:40] <hand> True.
    [2008-03-22 15:24:21] <hand> Maybe they're poisonous fish, though.
    [2008-03-22 15:24:23] <hand> Or maybe
    [2008-03-22 15:24:25] <WolfgangB> its a big fish
    [2008-03-22 15:24:40] <mathnerd314> You could argue they are penguin-eating piranhas.
    [2008-03-22 15:24:41] <hand> They have invisible spikes poke out of them at the moment of impact.
    [2008-03-22 15:24:48] <ohnobinki> the current fish that jump out of water look small enough for tux to handle, i thought
    [2008-03-22 15:25:12] <ohnobinki> the swordfish, etc on the wiki do make sense, though
    [2008-03-22 15:25:46] <hand> Is there a page on the wiki with all the badguys?  Just wondering..
    [2008-03-22 15:26:01] <ohnobinki> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Badguys
    [2008-03-22 15:26:14] <mathnerd314> Maybe Tux could carry a sword and be a samurai. 
    [2008-03-22 15:26:21] <hand> Ah, thanks
    [2008-03-22 15:26:38] <mathnerd314> Actually, the page lies.. spikes aren't badguys.
    [2008-03-22 15:27:39] <mathnerd314> Any cursory search of tiles.strf will show you that they are parts of the tilemap, like lava.
    [2008-03-22 15:28:18] <mathnerd314> Everything else is, however.
    [2008-03-22 15:30:58] <WolfgangB> http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Category:Badguy
    [2008-03-22 15:32:34] <mathnerd314> That works too.
    [2008-03-22 15:34:00] <mathnerd314> But it's missing some images.

    [2008-03-22 15:48:18] <Grumbel-c26c> not much commuity around it seems
    [2008-03-22 15:49:16] <mathnerd314> Maybe community discussions should be announced 2 months in advance with periodic reminders to get more people.
