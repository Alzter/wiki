As a side note, if you wish to contribute something positive to this project or it's associated wiki and still wish to use the Tor network to remain anonymous, I highly doubt anyone here has any problem. However, continued edits like this are not going to bring you good reputation and might end up in the subnets of these Tor exit nodes being blocked.

Actions like this are what make Tor and other anonymity services seem like features only criminals and jerks would want to use. Obviously that statement is outside the scope of your behavior here, and it isn't exactly relevant to this wiki. I just felt led to tell you that, as a proponet of internet privacy and freedom of speech. -- Qwood [[Special:Contributions/Qwood|(contribs)]] [[User talk:Qwood|(talk)]] 12:31, 16 July 2011 (UTC)
