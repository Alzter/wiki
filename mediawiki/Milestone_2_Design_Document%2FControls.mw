The game needs to take special care to distinguish between jump-with-up and jump-with-button. Running is automatic in this game.

== Configuration 1 (jump with button) ==

=== Level ===

* walk/run: left/right
* duck: down
* jump: button1
* grab: button2 
* backflip: down+button1

=== Worldmap/Menu ===

* walk: left/right/up/down
* enter level: button1

== Configuration 2 (jump with up) ==

=== Level ===

* walk/run: left/right
* duck: down
* jump: up
* grab: button1
* backflip: down quickly followed by up

=== Worldmap/Menu ===

* walk: left/right/up/down
* enter level: button1

Notes:

* backflip must work even when the user can't press duck and jump at the same time
* worldmap level entering is in one configuration done with the grab key and in the other with the jump key, this must be allowed
* escape/return aren't remappable in-game and hard bound to showing/hiding the menu
* peeking left/right handling stays as is
* a Start-button might be a worthy consideration, since its semantics are different from Escape
* allowing hot-plugging of joystick would be nice (calling 'Setup Joystick' should query the joysticks in the system)
* ladders behavior must be compatible with both configurations
