Here are my enemy ideas. They will be in Super Lemons.


== Bob ==
Bob is a simple idea for an enemy my friend made up. He normally stands around, but if Tux gets close, Bob will turn into a bear-thingy, and trap Tux, then throw him a great distance. If you are powered-up, this may actually help you.

== SnowTrap ==
SnowTrap's leap up at you from the ground. Normally they are disguised as regular snow, however with small black eyes.
