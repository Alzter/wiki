By the way, using [http://www.projecthoneypot.org/ip_137.56.163.46 Tor] to complain about language on a wiki is fairly hypocritical. Tor is not only based around anonymity but freedom from censorship as well. -- Qwood [[Special:Contributions/Qwood|(contribs)]] [[User talk:Qwood|(talk)]] 05:21, 16 July 2011 (UTC)
