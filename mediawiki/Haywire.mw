'''Haywire''' is a [[badguy]] from the [[Milestone 2 Design Document]]. It is very similar to [[Mr. Bomb]]: When jumped upon, the explosion sequence is triggered. In contrast to ''Mr.&nbsp;Bomb'', ''Haywire'' will not lie still but ran around madly. [[Tux]] can stun ''Haywire'' for a short while by jumping on it again, but should try to get out of its reach. When it explodes, hurts [[Tux]] and other badguys nearby.

When shot with a [[Fireflower]], explodes immediately.
