The ''SuperTux'' '''bug tracker''' can be found at:
:http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/

The Bugs page was moved to our [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs bug tracker]. See [[OldBugs]] for older versions.

== Using the bug tracker ==
:''This section is a todo. ''You can help'' by expanding it.''

=== Status of a bug report ===

Each bug report has an associated ''status''. When you first open a bug, its status is ''new'' and its resolution is set to ''open''.

Once the bug has been fixed or the new feature has been incorporated, the status is set to ''resolved'' and the resolution is set to ''fixed'' (or ''unable to reproduce'' or something like that).

==== More feedback ====
:''"What?! He resolved my bug without doing anything?!"''

It is common that the ''SuperTux'' team needs more information from you. In this case, the bug is also ''resolved'' and the resolution is set to ''suspended''. It is your responsibility as the reporter of the bug to ''re-open'' the bug report once you have the required information available. When you ''re-open'' the bug its status is (automatically) set to ''feedback'' and the resolution is set to ''reopened''. The team then knows that there is new information available and will review it.
