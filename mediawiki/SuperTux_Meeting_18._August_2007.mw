Supertux meeting: August 18, 2007

The SuperTux meeting today was great success, with participation from
wansti, grumbel, paroneayea, __delta, gwater (spectating), and
WolfgangB (briefly). IRC, Ekiga and netbrush were used in
conjunction, which seemed to be a very well working setup.

A couple of pages from netbrush (I'll be refering to these as [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/009f4fc9f2fefa975f8a61ac762b5613-canvas-12.png Image1]
and [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/69e2a41d51ed129242541fa7c52bc259-canvas-15.png Image2], respectively):

Focus of the meeting really seemed to be around World 1. We kind of
jumped all over the place, so I'm not going to try and stay in order,
but I'll try to break up topics as I see to be logical.

== Supertux ==

=== Powers revisited ===

SuperTux will be losing the ice/fire flower soon, as this is
considered a bit too powerful and makes the game a bit boring.
Instead, there will be several new environmental items and enemies
that will allow SuperTux to use powers. See "throwing snowballs" in
environments section as well as "Ice Dragon" and "Sand Shoe Monster"
in enemies section for examples.

=== Health revisited (no more small tux) ===

It seems generally agreed upon that the big/small tux is not really
much fun. The real purpose for big/small tux is for breakable
boxes, but there aren't too many of those in SuperTux anyway.
For the moment this will probably stay, but we're trying to
brainstorm some other health types. No idea was really liked, but
some other models that are worth thinking about are:

* "Capture the baby" in Yoshi's Island
* Zelda-like hearts
* Sonic coins


== Enemies ==

=== Enemies do not hurt each other ===

It seems to be well agreed upon that enemies should not hurt each
other any more (example, jumping snowball that can flatten other
snowballs) *unless* the player interacts with that enemy to cause this
effect. Which leads to...

=== Enemies as powerups ===

Discussions went around about several types of enemies who use
attacks against supertux, but which in certain situations (probably
after being briefly stunned) SuperTux himself should be able to
control.

Two categories of enemies were discussed:

* ''Carryable enemies:'' these enemies are carried around (much the way SuperTux currently carries an ice block), and their powers can be used to help tux attack other enemies, better maneuver the environment, et cetera. See baby "Ice Dragon" and "Snowshoes Monster" below.
* ''Riding enemies:'' These enemies Tux grabs on to and goes for a ride. See adult "Ice Dragon" below.

=== Ice Dragon ===

This enemy would probably come in both adult and baby form. There
are some drawings of him on the middle-left side of [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/009f4fc9f2fefa975f8a61ac762b5613-canvas-12.png Image1]. This
creature can spit ice blobs which can freeze Tux (who then has to
jump a lot to get free)

After being stunned, tux can grab on to this enemy and squeeze him
to shoot ice balls. The baby ice dragon, tux carries. The large
ice dragon, tux can ride on, and can also use to move around.

=== Snow/Sand-shoe Monster ===

In slushy snow or quicksand (see "Liquids" in environments for more
details), tux should be able to grab on to this character to safely
walk across quicksand or snow without sinking. (See [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/009f4fc9f2fefa975f8a61ac762b5613-canvas-12.png Image1], center)

=== Big Snowball ===

This snowball is made out of one smaller snowball on top, and one
big snowball on the bottom. When jumped on, the top snowball dies
and the bigger snowball on the bottom either will turn into a
"Rolling Snowball" (see Environments section) or another small
snowball.

It might be possible that one snowball can jump on top of another to
create a Big Snowball.

=== Yeti ===

It was agreed upon that the Yeti should no longer throw snowball
monsters, and should instead throw "Throwable snowballs", described
in "Environments"

== Environments ==

=== Throwable snowballs ===

This is an example of a temporary item that can be used as a
powerup. A pile of these are grabbed off of the ground, and they can
be thrown on an arc and then they disappear. (See [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/69e2a41d51ed129242541fa7c52bc259-canvas-15.png Image2], various
places). Since you only have a handful of these, they aren't a
boring "permanent" powerup like the ice/fire flower, and would have
to be dropped to do other things, grab onto other enemies, and such
strategic bits.

=== Sliding tux ===

A long discussed and desired feature is for Tux to be able to slide
on his belly along sloped surfaces. At the edge of ramps, Tux may
be able to perform something akin to a "ski jump". (see mid-right,
[http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/009f4fc9f2fefa975f8a61ac762b5613-canvas-12.png Image1]).

In the snow world, there should be able to be two places where this
can happen, on snowy grounds (where tux can choose to slide) and icy
surfaces (where tux slips and slides automatically). In other
worlds, there might sometimes be such slopes, maybe not. In the
forest world, there might be a waterfall, and in an industrial world
there might be a greased/oily slope.

=== Slippery surfaces ===

Icy surfaces aren't just for slopes! Icy, slippery ground that tux
has to walk across was discussed. Some developers expressed
reluctance, as the feeling of losing control on these kinds of
surfaces can feel frustrating. It was agreed upon that slippery
surfaces should be used *strategically*, for brief periods. An
example of this is on the upper-right of [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/009f4fc9f2fefa975f8a61ac762b5613-canvas-12.png Image1].

=== Swimming ===

Swimming will be postponed till Milestone 3.

=== Info boards (death of info boxes) ===

Info boxes tend to be abused, especially in custom levels. They
also create huge language-translation issues, and it is clear that
many of our users are very young (and who perhaps cannot read yet).

But a way of describing a new technique or ability is still
important in the game. It has been agreed that instead of info
boxes, we'll have "info boards". These will be graphical
descriptions of the activity, along with drawings of the button
mapping to perform it (which will be grabbed dynamically off of the
user's input settings). See lower-right of [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/009f4fc9f2fefa975f8a61ac762b5613-canvas-12.png Image1] for an example of
this.

Grumbel notes that this [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/ca5c98b54e92b1317776c49970f2bbbe-info-boxes-done-right.png this] is a good example of these being done right.

=== Floating and Tilting Icebergs/Islands ===

An idea borrowed from "Mission in Snowdriftland" (a Nintendo flash
game), these are little icebergs that tilt when the user steps to
one side of them.

These could float in water, or perhaps other liquids.... like...

=== Liquids ===

Water is an obvious liquid that already exists.

Acid might be a good one for tilting islands to float on that's a
bit more hazardous than water.

Quicksand/Slushy Snow is a kind of liqud that would be nice to have.
You have to keep hopping to keep from sinking (unless you grab on to
one of the above-mentioned snow/sand shoe monsters) (See middle of
[http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/009f4fc9f2fefa975f8a61ac762b5613-canvas-12.png Image1] for an example)

=== Avalanche ===

This would be a special type of level where snowballs at the top
come tumbling toward Tux. Tux has to keep running to keep from
getting crushed (think Indiana Jones and Crash Bandicoot). Being
touched by the snowballpile leads to instant death. See the
top-left of [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/69e2a41d51ed129242541fa7c52bc259-canvas-15.png Image2] for details.


== Story ==

Agreed that the story won't be touched much in the present version.
Acknowledged by everyone that the story is presently a bit sexist, but
milestone 3 should fix that, when Penny will be able to take over
gameplay for some period.


== Other ==

=== Levels introducing concepts ===

We'd like to move more toward individual levels introducing a new
concept in good detail, and then later levels can use those concepts
to less degrees, or as seen fit.

=== In-game Menus ===

Some thought should be put into menu selections. Super Mario Land 2
had a creative save menu system.. it didn't feel like normal
gameplay, but it felt interactive. But an in-game menu or options
menu (esp pause menu) should be much more basic.


== Managing the project ==

In the past SuperTux has not been really well managed. A lot of code
gets checked in that people are experimenting with, those features are
not really used, and it leads to a lot of cruft and a bloated, harder
to manage SuperTux.

We should manage SuperTux within context: a feature should be
developed with a level in mind, and then developed around that.


== Next meeting ==

Plans are to discuss world two and implementation. We'd like to have
more meetings like this, and do more of discussing our development
progress (not just coming up with new ideas)
