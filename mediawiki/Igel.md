'''Igel''' is a [[badguy]] in the second world of ''SuperTux'', the [[Forest]]. Igel cannot be squished or [[buttjump]]ed due to its spines but they can be shot with a [[fireflower]] when facing [[Tux]].

The term "Igel" is German for "hedgehog", which is precisely why the ''Igel'' in the game look like hedgehogs.

== Proposed behavior ==
:''Note: The behavior described below differs from the behavior currently implemented in the development version of ''SuperTux''.''

Although basically vulnerable to shots that hit the soft head, Igel will immediately curl up for some seconds as soon as being shot at, thus either absorbing or deflecting the shot.

Upon reaching a ledge or when [[Tux]] stands less than 5 tiles behind Igel, Igel will slowly turn around, facing the camera and thus exposing the only weakness: When hit by a bullet while facing the camera, Igel will flip over for some seconds and can be squished by jumping on the exposed belly.
