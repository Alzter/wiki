SuperTux uses the keyboard as the default input device.

In the current implementation, every action in SuperTux can be mapped to a key. The only exception is the hard-coded definition for the Enter and Escape keys, which, when pressed, either confirm or cancel an action. The Escape key is also used to pause the gameplay and display the in-game menu.
