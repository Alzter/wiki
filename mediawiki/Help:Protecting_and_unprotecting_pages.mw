{{PD Help Page}}
'''Protecting and unprotecting pages''' is very straightforward, but these operations require [[Help:Sysops and permissions|sysop permissions]].

You can designate a page as a [[Help:Protected pages|protected page]] by clicking the 'Protect page' tab, and supplying a comment (a brief textual description of why you are protecting the page)

There are several reasons why a particular page might be protected. Typically a protected page is one which has been repeatedly targeted with vandalism, or where it is believed that any vandalism would have a unusually severe impact. However there are also many good reasons for ''not'' protecting pages. As a sysop you must make this choice, and wield your power responsibly.
