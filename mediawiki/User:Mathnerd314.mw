== About me ==
I'm a bored college student who has a laptop (with Windows 7, currently), an internet connection (the university's fast one, sometimes, but usually a slow one), and very little free time. I program Java, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80 z80 assembly], and some C and C++ (because of its similarity to Java), but my favorite language is definitely [http://www.haskell.org/ Haskell]. I am currently trying to get through college.

== Current Projects ==
I'm not very active, but occasionally I submit patches to various Firefox addons that I use. I might get back into SuperTux development, depending on how my class load is.
