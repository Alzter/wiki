'''Nutty''' is a proposed and currently ''unimplemented'' [[badguy]]. He could take the place of [[MrIceBlock|Mr. IceBlock]] and [[Snail|Slow Snail]] in certain areas. When being jumped upon, he becomes a coconut with no eyes or feet. He can then be kicked or carried.

He could also be a completely invincible walking badguy that can't harm Tux. He simply acts as a blockade or even a platform for Tux to hitch a ride.

Suggestion: Maybe this thing should be called Mr. Coco?
:Mr. Coco is okay, but the Mr. prefix is overused. What about just Coco? [[User:Tuxnut|TUX/âˆšUT]] ([[User talk:Tuxnut|plz talk 2 me internets]] | [[Special:Contributions/Tuxnut|view horrendous deeds]]) 21:47, 21 June 2010 (UTC)
How about Mr. Coconut? [[User:Monster|Monstertux]]
