'''Mr. Palm Tree''' is a proposed badguy in the [[Tropical Island]]. He is made of three to five segments. If Tux lands on the top segment, the bottom segment is squished. Through repeated squishes, Tux can kill Mr. Palm Tree.

Mr. Palm Tree could spawn [[Nutty]] badguys, but that might be a job for a different badguy...Mr. Coconut Tree?

::<small>Perhaps Palmy acts as a kind of dispenser with a limited stock of, say, three coconuts. [[User:Tuxnut|TUX/âˆšUT]] ([[User talk:Tuxnut|plz talk 2 me internets]] * [[Special:Contributions/Tuxnut|view horrendous deeds]]) 16:39, 25 June 2010 (UTC)
Idea: how about when he gets hit by a sliding bad guy, he drops 2 or 3 nuttys. [[user:Monster|Monstertux]]</small>
