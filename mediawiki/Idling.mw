Sometimes Tux just stands still. To make things more interesting we should have some animations in this case as well.

Examples:
* Shaking his head
* Flapping his flaps
* Open/close an eyelid
* Yawning or falling asleep
* Whistling a tune
* Tapping his feet in impatience
* Getting more and more angry the longer he is left.

It would also be nice to make him turn and face the 'camera' if an idle timer was exceeded.
