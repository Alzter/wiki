= Actions =

The major change in the basic actions will be making running automatic. Running will automatically happen when you have walked continuously into a certain direction and will be different by a new animation. The acceleration phase will be long enough to be able to make walking-jumps. The jump height should be similar to what it is now with different height for run and jump. The current implementation of having a walk-key and [[Milestone 1|Milestone-1]]-style running by default is ''not'' the intended final behavior.
:What means "current" here? Which [[SVN]] revision are you referring to? --[[User:Octo|octo]] 08:38, 6 March 2010 (UTC)

Rationale: The run key is overlooked by many people making the game extremely frustrating and annoying for them, since it isn't obvious that there is one, the tutorial situation in the form of a high wall in Milestone1 didn't really fix the problem, since we got still plenty of questions about the situation. It also serves little purpose since more experienced players will basically always press it down, i.e. almost nobody actually walks through the game on purpose.

== Jumping ==

When standing or walking, [[Tux]] can jump ''four tiles'' high. When running or using the [[backflip]] jump, ''Tux'' can jump ''five tiles'' high.
: ''(This if from the top of my head. Please correct if this is wrong. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 08:33, 6 March 2010 (UTC))''

'''FIXME:'''
* How high, how is it influenced by running?
* How far can Tux jump, i.e. what is the widest "normal" gap width that should occur in levels?

== Running ==

Walking and running velocity and acceleration are defined in [[Template:SvnFile|src/object/player.cpp]]. Currently those values are:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! Name
! Value
! Description
|-
| <code>WALK_ACCELERATION_X</code>
| 300
| acceleration in horizontal direction when walking
|-
| <code>RUN_ACCELERATION_X</code>
| 400
| acceleration in horizontal direction when running
|-
| <code>MAX_WALK_XM</code>
| 230
| maximum walk velocity (pixel/s)
|-
| <code>MAX_RUN_XM</code>
| 320
| maximum horizontal climb velocity
|-
| <code>WALK_SPEED</code>
| 100
| instant velocity when tux starts to walk
|}

'''FIXME:'''
* How fast, how does it influence jump, how long is acceleration?

== Backflip ==
The backflip is a special jump which gives Tux some extra height compared to a normal jump.
<br clear="all" />

== Flapping ==
By flapping his wings Tux is able to get a short amount of additional time in the air as well as gain a tile in height.

Reasons to have it: fits the penguin, interesting gameplay mechanic, has a reference implementation in the form of Yoshi Island

Reasons to not have it: Has been tried with not so much success

Problem: Its a "now or never" game mechanic, it changes the game to much to be introduced at a later point.

'''Will be ignored for now'''

<br clear="all" />

== Butt Jump ==
[[Image:Supertux-buttjump.png|thumbnail|right|Butt Jump]]
The Butt Jump is activated by pressing down while in the air. It causes Tux to crush down on the exact spot over which he currently is. The butt jump provides additional force that allows him to crush blocks and some kind of armored enemies.
<br clear="all" />

== Blow Flyer ==
[[Image:Tux_bubble.png|thumbnail|right|Tux in Bubble Mode]]

Tux body catches a lot of hot air and thus starts to float. This action is triggered by objects in the game world and automatically terminates after some amount of time.

Can interact with wind.

'''Will be implemented later, not a high priority item'''

<br clear="all" />

== Sliding down Slopes ==

When on a slope you can press 'duck' and then slide down the slope, killing enemies in your way.

[[Category:Development]]


= Milestone_2_Design_Document%2FControls =

[[Template:Navbox Milestone 2 Design Document]]
= Controls =

The game needs to take special care to distinguish between jump-with-up and jump-with-button. Running is automatic in this game.

== Configuration 1 (jump with button) ==

=== Level ===

* walk/run: left/right
* duck: down
* jump: button1
* grab: button2 
* backflip: down+button1

=== Worldmap/Menu ===

* walk: left/right/up/down
* enter level: button1

== Configuration 2 (jump with up) ==

=== Level ===

* walk/run: left/right
* duck: down
* jump: up
* grab: button1
* backflip: down quickly followed by up

=== Worldmap/Menu ===

* walk: left/right/up/down
* enter level: button1

Notes:

* backflip must work even when the user can't press duck and jump at the same time
* worldmap level entering is in one configuration done with the grab key and in the other with the jump key, this must be allowed
* escape/return aren't remappable in-game and hard bound to showing/hiding the menu
* peeking left/right handling stays as is
* a Start-button might be a worthy consideration, since its semantics are different from Escape
* allowing hot-plugging of joystick would be nice (calling 'Setup Joystick' should query the joysticks in the system)
* ladders behavior must be compatible with both configurations

[[Template:Navbox Milestone 2 Design Document]]
__NOTOC__
This page shall describe all enemies, old and new, in as much detail as possible. We also need to settle down on proper names for enemies, since currently there is a lot of confusion. If you want see on real names, click [[real_badguys_names|here]].

<br clear="all" />

== [[Snowball]] ==

[[Image:SnowballSprite.png|right]]

Snowball is a straight forward walking enemy, when reaching an edge he will fall down and continue walking on the platform below. Jumping on him will squish him and thus kill him.

'''Status:''' Basic behavior is implemented, could however be improved with additional animations when turning around or when falling from a cliff. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 09:41, 23 February 2010 (UTC)
<br clear="all" />

== <strike>[[Mrs. Snowball]]</strike> smartball ==

[[Image:SmartSnowballSprite.png|right]]

Mrs. Snowball behaves like a normal [[Snowball]], but instead of walking off a platform she will turn around when reaching the edge.
<br clear="all" />

== [[Snowman]] ==
[[Image:SnowmanSprite.png|right]]
A snowman enemy shall be added, a snowman is build out of a base body combined with a snowball head, if the body is destroyed, the snowman turns into a snowball. Alternative: Let the head get destroyed and the body turn into a snowball that can be rolled around.

'''Status:''' A very basic Snowman prototype is in [[SVN]], but lacks death animation and the whole separation behavior. Could use fists instead of balls as hands. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 09:39, 23 February 2010 (UTC)
: Basic separation behavior has been implemented in [[Template:Revision|6418]]. We're missing a graphic for the Snowman's body though. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 19:07, 27 February 2010 (UTC)
: The snowman's body is now falling down when he's squished. [[User:Grumbel|grumbel]] wants to make a proper death graphic though. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 22:20, 2 March 2010 (UTC)
<br clear="all" />

== <strike>Bouncy, </strike>Bouncing Snowball ==

[[Image:BouncingSnowball.png|right]]
The [[Bouncing Snowball]] is a leg-less Snowball that jumps around like a ball.

'''Status:''' Jump height and width could be tweaked a bit to make it easier to stand below it. Placement in the levels is the biggest problem, should only be used in open spaces, not closed ones where bouncing becomes unpredictable. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 09:48, 23 February 2010 (UTC)
<br clear="all" />

== <strike>Avior, Dex,</strike> Flying Snowball ==
[[Image:Flyingsnowball.png|Flying Snowball|right]]
The flying snowball has a propeller at his bottom which keeps him floating in the air. Due to Nolok's hurry, the motor is inefficient and varies in effectiveness, causing the flying snowball to move up and down while coughing out smoke and possibly other debris.

'''In need of a "good" name.'''

What about Mr. Flyball?--[[User:Noporque|Noporque]] 09:00, 10 April 2010 (UTC)

Here are some ideas: Flyper, Propeller, Gadget, and Floatall. I'm Agent Spook, and I'm just trying to help.

<br clear="all" />

== <strike>[[Snowshot]]</strike> kamikazesnowball ==
[[Image:Kamikaze-left2.png|Snowshot|right]]
The [[Snowshot]] comes out of a [[Cannon]]. He is very angry, or very "wise", and so can levitate through the force of his will. He is so concentrated on this, however, that he cannot turn or adjust his velocity.

'''Status:''' There is MrRocket in SVN which should be recycled and turned into a Snowshot. There is also a cannon that can be reused after its graphics have been replaced. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 11:55, 23 February 2010 (UTC)
: There's a Kamikaze Snowball in SVN, too. "Mr. Rocket" has been removed in [[Template:Revision|6408]]. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 21:03, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
<br clear="all" />

== [[Mr. IceBlock]] ==

[[Image:MrIceblockSprite.png|right]]
Like Snowball, Mr. IceBlock is a simple straight forward enemy. He will not stay on platforms. When jumped upon he will get knocked out and become a portable item that one can use to throw at other enemies.
<br clear="all" />

== <strike>Fuse,</strike> MrBomb ==

[[Image:Mrbomb.png|right]]
The base behavior of [[Mr. Bomb]] is similar to the normal Snowball, except that when hit he doesn't get squished, but his fuse starts burning. After ~5 seconds he then explodes. While the fuse is burning he doesn't move, but instead can be carried around like an iceblock. Throwing MrBombs is more like a normal throw, not like MrIceblock getting kicked.

'''Status:''' Explosion timing is wrong, should be long enough to grab it and carry it around. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 09:51, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

<br clear="all" />

== [[Haywire]],(Crazy Fuse) ==

[[Image:MrBombCrazy.png|right]]

When the fuse isn't burning Haywire looks similar to a normal Bomb except color and face.
When the fuse of Haywire gets activated he starts to run around, maybe chasing Tux. He can't be carried around. Jumping on him when the fuse is burning will cause Tux to bounce and Haywire to be stunned for a short moment (fraction of a second).

'''Status:''' An initial version is available since [[Template:Revision|6443]].

<br clear="all" />

== [[Crystallo]] ==

[[Image:Crystallo.png|right]]

Again a very basic enemy, but unlike the Snowball he doesn't walk around in a straight pattern, but walks forward and backward around a fixed position. It is a stationary enemy.
<br clear="all" />

== [[Spiky]] ==

[[Image:SpikySprite.png|right]]
Spiky behaves like ''Mrs. Snowball'', i.e. he stays on platforms, but he carries a helmet which makes him invulnerable against jump attacks.

<br clear="all" />

== <strike>Sleeping Spiky</strike> Spiky ==

[[Image:SleepingSpikySprite.png|right]]
Sleeping Spiky sleeps, when Tux comes near he activates and behaves like a normal Spiky. (Grumbel: Not sure that guy is a good idea)
<br clear="all" />

== <strike>Recoil, SnowJumpy</strike> Jumpy ==

[[Image:SnowJumpySprite.png|right]]
[[Jumpy]] jumps up and down and stays stationary on the same position. His viewing direction might follow [[Tux]]. The spring should react when hitting the ground.

<br clear="all" />

== Ice Fish / [[Fish]] == 

[[Image:IceFish.png|right]]
Already in the code, but not much used in Milestone1 Levels. This badguy shouldn't be used in Icyland, it is a forest enemy. 
<br clear="all" />

== [[Owl]] ==
[[Image:Owl.png|right]]
A flying enemy that can carry things around and let them drop on Tux. One thing it is throwing might be ''SkyDive''.

Some initial code is available from the [[SVN]] repository since [[Template:Revision|6558]]. Graphics are still pretty much a to-do. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 17:25, 6 March 2010 (UTC)

<br clear="all" />

== [[SkyDive]] == 

[[Image:BombFish.png|right]]
An enemy that is let go by ''Owl'' and then falls down to the ground and explodes.

An initial version of this badguy has been committed to [[SVN]] in [[Template:Revision|6564]].

<br clear="all" />

== <strike>[[Krush and Krosh]]</strike> Icecrusher ==
[[Image:Iceblock.png|right]]

Krush and Krosh are enemies that are hanging on the ceiling. When [[Tux]] gets within one tile they will fall down and try to smash Tux. When hanging on the ceiling, Krush and Krosh'es eyes shall follow Tux. The face expression shall become angry when he is falling down.

'''Status:''' Needs a cool-down time after an attack, so it doesn't go up instantly. Needs particle effects when it hits the ground. Eyes should follow Tux. Should be larger, maybe 3x3 tiles or 4x4. Should accelerate while falling down, currently looks to much like constant velocity. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 09:54, 23 February 2010 (UTC)
: Acceleration has been fixed in [[Template:Revision|6403]]. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 19:38, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
: A cooldown timer has been added in [[Template:Revision|6405]]. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 19:49, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
<br clear="all" />

== ([[Cannon]]) Dispenser ==
[[Image:Dispenser rocket launcher.png|right]]
The cannon can be mounted on either static or rotatable pedestal. It shoots angry looking snowballs. It is indestructible.
[[SVN]] for non-captainsnowball/kamizazesnowball enemies
: The version in SVN can in fact shoot [[Snowshot]]s. Can this sentence be removed or do you mean something else? --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:55, 27 February 2010 (UTC)
: I didn't find any mention of [[Captain Snowball]] in neither the Milestone 2 nor the Milestone 3 design documents. What's the status on him? --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:55, 27 February 2010 (UTC)
:Captain snowball is used in several level in bonus 3 --[[User:giby|giby]] Fev 2014
<br clear="all" />

== [[Stalactite]] ==
[[Image:Falling.png|Stalactite|right]]
The stalactite stays stuck to the ceiling until Tux walks near it, then begins shaking. After a bit of shaking, it falls down in an attempt to hurt Tux, while also harming badguys that get in the way.

<br clear="all" />

== [[Flame]] ==
[[Image:Flame.png|Flame|right]]
The flame rotates around in a circle, hurting Tux when he gets too close. It is indestructible. Do we want it to come in a line of fire?

<br clear="all" />

== 295 ==
[[Image:up.png|right]]The spike isn't really an enemy, so much as an obstacle, but for some strange reason, it's in the creatures' image directory, but implemented as a tile. Currently the spike only hurts Tux, instead of insta-killing him as might be wanted, for example at the bottom of deep pits. Alternately, we could simply have shallow pits that are easy to jump out of. (but that still hurt Tux)

== [[Short Fuse]], <strike>Mini Bomb</strike> ==
[[Image:Short Fuse.png|right]]
[[Image:Minibomb.png|thumbnail|right|Mini-Bomb]]
The Mini-Bomb is an small version of the normal bomb, it approaches in groups most of the time and is aggressive, it however is non-lethal to Tux and only works to either distract him and throw him back.

A first version of this badguy has been added to [[SVN]] in [[Template:Revision|6511]].

Should "pop" like it was filled with air pressure air, not explode in fire, to make it clear that its not deadly.

<br clear="all" />

== Spitter (proposed) ==
[[Image:Spitter.png|thumbnail|right|Spitter]]
The spitter acts as walking dispenser, the enemy type that he can spit out might be limited to mini-bombs and similarly small enemies.
<br clear="all" />



== Yeti ==
[[Image:Yeti-concept.jpg|thumbnail|right|64px|Yeti]]
[[Image:Yetiapproach.png|thumbnail|left|Yeti Boss Cutscene]]

The Yeti is the boss that awaits Tux in the first castle. After entering the throne room Tux will find a letter in which Nolok tells Tux of the other castles in other worlds (see Milestone1 extro.txt). In the background there is a window. While reading the note one will see a shadow approaching the window and soon after the Yeti jumping through the window. The normal boss battle starts instantly after the jump.

Alternative: Sequence at end of castle: Tux find Yeti, Yeti jumps out of the window and flees
<br clear="all" />

== Gulpy, <strike>Eater</strike> (proposed) ==
[[Image:Eater.png|thumbnail|right|Eater]]
The Eater is a very small enemy, half the size of a snowball, he can however expand a lot. If Tux gets to close to him the Eater will open his mouth wide enough that he can devour Tux or even other badguys. He is not defeatable by jumping onto him, since he will then just eat Tux. Throwing stuff at him won't work either, since again he will just eat them.

: So how can you defeat Gulpy? As-is, he just seems to be a moving hurting platform. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 23:28, 7 March 2010 (UTC)

= Milestone_2_Design_Document%2FEngine =

[[Template:Navbox Milestone 2 Design Document]]
= Screensize/Aspect-Ratio =

Milestone2 will allow near total freedom in setting the screensize and the size of the projected area:

 ./supertux -g 1280x1024:1680x1050

This command for example will give a Window of 1280x1024, but with the visible area of a level being 1680x1050.

This means that level design must not focus on 800x600, but should be flexible enough even when the user has a much larger visible area. However all levels should remain playable even as low as 640x480.

The maximum resolution to deal with is 1920x1200 (HD-TV Monitor), 2560x1600 (Apple 30" Cinema Display) can't be handled since that would cause issues with enemy respawning, the respawn distance is currently 1600x1200, relative to Tux.

Maximum resolution might be limited to 1280x800, with everything larger getting upscaled.

* with a windows larger then 1280x800 the content will be scaled up, letter boxes will be used where useful
* with a window between 640x480-1280x800 the visible playfield will resize
* with a window smaller then 640x480 the content will be scaled down

== Questions ==

Might 1280x1024 be a better choice then 1280x800, as its a common LCD resolution?
: Maybe, if levels would have build in verticallity, at the moment they are just scaled to 25 tiles, which isn't enough for 1024, thus letterboxing. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 11:11, 26 February 2010 (UTC)

== Unstable tiles ==

Change [[unstable tile]]s to be have like one of those:
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22RH2auraFs#t=3m40s Crumbling ground in Giana Sisters DS]
** Blocks crumble until they disappear. Then the player falls through.
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_SqtR3xFpM#t=1m20s Donut Blocks in Super Mario World]
** Blocks fall down without crumbling first. The player can still jump off of them.

== Reset Points ==

There shall be no reset points in the game, instead it should be made sure that levels are small enough to not require them. 

== No Lives ==

There will be no lives and no punishment for death aside from having to restart the level, due to the lack of reset points there simply is no need for lives.

== Collectibles ==

The game shall provide some form of special collectibles per level (5 special coins, 5 pieces of a crystal or stuff like that). How many of those collectibles are found is displayed in a prominent manner, not just part of the statistics. The Tux-doll (ex-1up) could be recycled for this purpose.

= Meeting Notes =

<pre>
Code:
- engine problems blending
- monster activation should be dependent on tux position and
  not on screen position (like it is now) because it should
  be independent from aspect ratio
  (Note for level designers: Think that potentially the user
  can see the whole level in front of him)
- Code for butt jump

Objects:
- new object to place images into levels (to replace info boxes):

http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/ca5c98b54e92b1317776c49970f2bbbe-info-boxes-done-right.png

Menu System Rework:
- Scrolling level selection list
- Buttons in menus
- Add info box below menu (with explanations)

Profile system:
- create profiles
- delete profiles
- load default profile on startup

- Restart game on language change (do not put language change menu into
the
       Pause-Options menu)

Graphics:
- running animation
- butt jump animation
- improve egg graphics, so it does not seem like a "snowball"
- graphics for the stuff in "Creatures"

Behaviour:
- Angry Iceblock: like the mario blocks (in the castles)
- Owl: unclear... Carriers objects and drops them at tux somehow, but not clear.
- Canon: like in mario: shoots left/right
- MiniBomb: accelerates, follows tux (but does not jump)
- Eater: ?

Snowmen:
- take the jogger one for fall-down snowball
- take the japanese one for the gun
- take the "normal" one for stay on platform
- take the "ninja" for following tux

Enemy Code:
- support for spawning k-children in an enemy (for spitter for example)

Mods:
- we might want to support "mods". A mod is defined in that it replaces
stuff
that is already there (instead of only adding new stuff). Undecided if
we want
it and how exactly.

Controls:
- we need to support jump with up and jump with button
- support binding for left,right,up,down. allow double up+jump config

Game mechanics:
- no costs for reset points
- Mailinglist discussion: do we want reset points?
- Remove global coin counter, coin count is only per level now  (similar to collectibles)
- Add collectibles: per level, show them in the screen while playing the level
- When you find a collectible, fade in collectible count for a short time
- In pause mode show all collectible as once

Mailing lists:
- We want a separate team mailing list.
  Proposal: create supertux-user and supertux-team. make forward
  supertux-devel mails to supertux-user. supertux-team read everyone but write
  only for people with svn access...

World1:
- levels will be changed, and reworked to make use of the new features

Yeti:
- Sequence at end of castle: Tux find Yeti, Yeti jumps out of the window and  flees
</pre>

== 2008-01-31 ==

Code:
* New Badguy "Ice Crusher", falls down to crush Tux, then rises back up. Has a platform on its top
* Remove old Cannon, Dropper graphics and use new Cannon instead. Only shoots left and right
* Butt-Jump should easily be possible. Press down in midair to make Tux stop in mid-air and drop down vertically. Current effect is just fine. Don't forget to shake the camera.

Game:
* Figure out which Russian Translation to use (contact translators).
* Build test level using snow slopes.
* Do not use Ice Flower. It's not finished yet.

Graphics:
* Fix jumping Tux animation. It has weird black marks.
* Make Tux backflip animation smoother.
* New tileset for above-ground levels.
* New decorative tiles. Ice cracks, snowmen, cavemen, areas with more transparency, ...
* Frozen tree.

* Sounds for Ice Crusher, Flying Snowball, Snowball splashing against wall. Sound of rockets exploding is too loud.


= Milestone_2_Design_Document%2FStyleguide =

[[Template:Navbox Milestone 2 Design Document]]
These guidelines should be kept for any level that appears in the main SuperTux level sequence. Any deviation should be rare and with great consideration (for example for a secret area).  Designers making custom levels intended for an [[Add-on]] or Bonus Island are free of regulations - that's what those sections are for.  However, keep in mind that if your levels violate too many of these suggestions people will likely find them not very fun.

== Setting ==

In [[Milestone 2]], will have [[Icy Island]] as game discovering area,  the island already present in [[Milestone 1]]. It has a snow and ice setting, so please use the appropriate [[tile]]s only. Most of them are in the "Snow" and "Blocks" groups in the level editor. There are numerous other tiles currently available in the editor, but they are either either not finalized (e.g. ice mountain) or not appropriate for ''Icy Island''.  In that first world, only basic elements should be found. 
It will present a revised [[Forest]], where more elaborate elements may be found. The Boss have to be designed. 
And eventually a third world (proposed to be [[Tropical_Island]]) with the Fun Pif quest. Please Note that Neither art or code is ready yet for this part, then you shall not design any level with their elements already available.

== Difficulty ==

The goal of ''SuperTux'' is to be fun, not to be hard. So the goal is to make ''fun'' levels, not to make them ''challenging''. Remember that a player will get frustrated and annoyed if he dies more than small number of times in a level and also keep in mind that a player will see the level for the first time when he plays it.

'''Tip:''' If you are in doubt if a level is getting too hard, change the style of play to something that is unfamiliar to you, invert left/right controls, play with the left hand, play only as small Tux or anything like that. If you can still beat the level without problems and without dying, it likely is easy enough. If not, then it is likely too hard.

== Enemies ==

Do not randomly mix enemies of all different kinds.  Level should follow a certain theme and thus focus on enemies that fit that theme.  For example, fire enemies should only appear in castle levels.  In addition, don't just randomly place each and every type of snow enemy into a level- pick a few enemies that best fit into your level.

Be mindful of how enemies react to the environment when deciding where to put them.  For example, snowball will always fall off ledges while smartball will always turn around at a ledge, thus snowball is a poor choice in a sky level where smarball is much more appropriate.  Enemies should not fall off the screen before players have a chance to engage them, and it should be possible to fill out the ''badguys killed'' stat.  Finally avoid placing enemies where they will reach a spawn point.  This is most important around the level start and reset points, as there should be ample time for a player to see and assess the level before being forced to act.  Levels that switch back-and-forth between sectors are also prone to having an enemy wander into a spawn point resulting in Tux being hurt immediately after spawning- this is bad and makes players sad.

== Slopes ==

When creating slopes, make sure that they are smooth and don't make sudden jumps in inclination.  Note when using slopes that some combinations are ill-fitting; ignore these artifacts as they are graphics problems, not level problems.  You may want to avoid the use of steep slopes for the time being, at least until the slope collision physics are improved some more.  Along those same lines, the placement of slopes directly next to a vertical wall currently produces some bizarre behavior and should be avoided until the mechanics are improved.

[[Image:Styleguide_slope.png|Styleguide Slope]]

== Tiles ==

Don't use tiles in the background that were built for the foreground. Use only special background tiles in the background. In general, don't ever mix tilesets. Clearly distinguish between the layers - players should be able to see immediately where they can safely walk and what is foreground and background. Secret areas can violate this.

[[Image:Styleguide_tiles.png|Styleguide Tiles]]

== Size ==

Levels ''must'' be at least 25 tiles high, and using at least 32 tiles is recommended. Levels should be between 250 and 350 tiles long.<br />(A couple of levels in [[Icy Island]] are over 500&nbsp;tiles long – newer levels should not be this long and it's possible we'll split up those long levels in the future.)<br />Any vertical scrolling sector should be no narrower than 40 tiles wide to ensure it displays well in every resolution setting currently supported by SuperTux.

== File Naming Conventions ==

When saving the level file, stick with the convention used for the worldmap.  For example, ''Icy Island'' levels are named like this:  ''02 - example level.stl'' where the number (02 in the example) showing what order you play the levels, and the level name are separated by a hyphen.  The level extension is ''.stl'', if you forget the extension, the level will not be recognized.  If you need an example of naming convention, look at the data/levels/world1 directory.  If level order does not matter, or is unknown, the number and hyphen can be omitted.

Note: having spaces in the level names makes command-line manipulation of files for development atrocious, there should probably be a discussion about changing the convention to use underscores in the level names instead.

However, it's not critical that custom levels necessarily follow the same naming convention.  It is nevertheless best to stick with a non-cryptic naming scheme where it is obvious which file is for which level.

== Sectors ==

[[Image:nsb.png|thumbnail|right|How NOT bind sectors together]]
When making a level, use floors and ceilings where appropriate. Basic rule of thumb is that your environment should visually make sense.  For example:
* Overground areas should have a floor and no ceiling.
* Underground/cave and interior areas should have both a floor and a ceiling.
* Sky area should have neither a floor nor ceiling.

Transitions between sectors should also make sense.  Having Tux walk off a screen of overground ice and suddenly appearing in the middle of a castle is confusing.  Also one-way sector transitions should only be used where it is logical, such as dropping down a hole.  Doors should be two-way.  Sectors designed to be next to each other should be able to be visually connected.

== Other ==

SuperTux is meant to be a fair and fun game, so don't create unfair configurations, like a spike on the roof as well as one on the ground, that require way too much precision or luck and just aren't fun to play.

[[Image:Howtonotdesignlevels.jpg|right|thumb|200px|How '''NOT''' to design levels]]
[[Image:Hallofshame.jpg|right|thumb|200px|More things to avoid]]

Other things to avoid:

# Creating paths that are only two tiles high, make things high enough that SuperTux can jump.
# Don't create jumps that require pixel perfect precision unless it is for a special secret area.
# Don't use invisible tiles for normal gameplay.
# Keep the number of enemies that are on the screen at once small, it shouldn't be more then three for most cases.
# Do not overuse switches and doors: SuperTux isn't an adventure game, it's a jump'n run, so make the level straightforward and easy to understand.
# Avoid creating large monotonous spaces; players get tired of running around a huge level.
# Try to limit the use of reset points; if you can get away with none whatsoever, do so.
# Don't allow dead ends or impossible levels; either the player dies, or there's still a way to solve it. (Allowing the player to suicide from a trap works as well) Test your level thoroughly to find possible paths you missed before.
# Avoid too hard or too easy levels. Too easy levels get boring very quickly while too hard ones can be frustrating. Levels you built often appear a lot easier for yourself, so be sure to let other people test them.
# Secret areas should be well-hidden and not be visible on first sight, but can still have a visual cue that they are there. Use your imagination to think of new ways to create secrets - some of the above rules can be broken for that purpose, but be careful!
# Avoid impossible-to-reach coins, powerups, areas, and badguys. Collecting everything or reaching everywhere in a level is often important to players. However, difficulty can be just short of impossible - requiring frame-by-frame accuracy is fine. (So long as you provide a demo to prove that it is in fact possible) This only applies to bonus items - players should be able to complete the level minus some items with only moderate difficulty.
# Avoid using any water. Swimming and water physics have not been finalized, so any current water behavior is unreliable.
# Avoid using very steep slopes or placing slopes next to vertical walls, the collision physics is still a bit off.
# Don't overuse "new" things (enemies, objects, tiles): Use them when and where they make sense. Don't use them just because they are new.
# Change gravity only when it has sense. Don't change it, when you want only Tux jumping higher/lower.

= Milestone_2_Design_Document%2FTasks =

[[Template:Navbox Milestone 2 Design Document]]

[[Template:nextversion]]
== Code Tasks ==
* properly GPL'ify the supertux-editor (COPYING file, GPL headers, etc.)
* SDL2 migration (and all related side effect)

== Sound and Music Tasks ==
* Improve the sounds
* Compress music more. The 40 MBytes of music make up two thirds of the source tarball.

== Graphics / Sprites ==
* Create SuperTux idle animations (<del>stage1: blinking with the eye,</del> stage2: tipping with the foot, stage3: scratching the head)
** <small>I've added the code for idle animations, we just need the graphics now. The blinking animation already exists, but it needs some tweaking - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 06:25, 16 June 2008 (UTC)</small>
** [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=681]
* when Tux dies he can fly behind blocks instead of in front of them, drawing order bug
* Tux isn't centered properly to his collision box
* repair jump Tux sprite (to dark black) (Grumbel)
* do a 32x32 top-down water animation for the worldmap
** use these tiles [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=852]
* finish [[cannon]] graphics, also snowball graphics, death, etc (Grumbel)
* [[Snowman]] graphics (death animation, turn-around graphics) (Grumbel)
* [[Owl]] graphics (basically placeholder graphics right now) <small>—[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:53, 9 March 2010 (UTC)</small>
* some decor for ice tiles, cracks and stuff (Grumbel)
* finish icecrusher graphics
* deep snow tiles
** [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=911]
* icicle graphics for decoration purpose
** [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=911] an okay job, but not the best -CT.da'Bomb
* animate minibomb
* think of a new way to represent the exit area (snow molted with smooth ground below or so)
* add turn-around animation for smart-snowball

== Editor / Developer Conveniences ==

*# directly accessible powerups
* finish editor improvements (MatzeB)
* editor doesn't align [[Cannon]] and [[Krush and Krosh]] properly (grid is wrong)
** I think it's using the 0,0-position of the ''image'' to align objects, not the ''hitbox''. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:50, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

== Meta / Organization ==
* create a timeline what shall be done and when — [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Timeline]]
* discuss in the meetings what shall be done over the coming week — [[Next Meeting Agenda]]

== Menu System / Game Configuration ==
* add gamma control to the option menu, see: int SDL_SetGamma (float redgamma, float greengamma, float bluegamma);
* make aspect ratio option menu thing work
* need to properly auto-detect and set aspect ratio on games first startup (i.e. on a 1280x1024 screen aspect must be set to 5:4, not 4:3)
* option menu entries are currently not in sync with gameconfig
* add scale-with-window option to magnification or something like that
* make left/right change an option in the menu, let enter apply it (needed for fullscreen)

== Levels / Scripting / Gameplay ==
* level startup needs a fade-in, so does game startup, level abort and a few other places
* add all fade-in/out effects to DisplayEffect
* camera vertical scroll doesn't work properly in a small window (i.e. it doesn't move at all)

== Other ==
* aspect ratio init code (Grumbel)
* think about peeking in relation to large screen size
** <small>Maybe disable peeking if the resolution is at a certain size or greater? Tux would just be centered. [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 18:34, 30 April 2009 (UTC)</small>

== Enemies ==
* fix and cleanup all the enemy names - see [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Enemies]] for new names
** A beginning has been made by renaming ''Kamikaze Snowball'' to [[Snowshot]]. There's not much consensus about the other changes though, see [[Meeting 2010-02-27]]. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:01, 5 March 2010 (UTC)
* AngryBonusBlock: Have a bonus block type that comes to life when tux jumps against it and then chases Tux
:Break the "only good stuff from bonus blocks" and "same look same behaviour" rules? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 01:27, 25 May 2008 (UTC)
::Secret Maryo has a poisonous mushroom... if they break the rules, why not us? Also, bonus blocks already have varied behaviors. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 04:23, 7 September 2008 (UTC)
* create an enemy type that doesn't just walk straight into one direction, but does something different depending on Tux direction (ninja)
** <small>Is this a dupe of the Crystallo proposal for week 4? - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 19:58, 15 May 2008 (UTC)</small>
*** <small>No, this enemy is intelligent (reacts to Tux) --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 20:43, 19 March 2010 (UTC) </small>
* [[Mr. Bomb]]: let the fuse burn after one touched it
* [[Flying Snowball]]: Remove randomness, should be periodic and predictable
* [[Flying Snowball]]: Change timings to match that of Milestone1
* [[Flying Snowball]]: smoke effect for the motor seem to be to seldomly triggered
* [[Krush and Krosh|Icecrusher]]: gravitation instead of linear, facial expression.
*: Gravitation has been done in [[Template:Revision|6403]]. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 19:19, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
* [[Krosh]] (big icecrusher): add a larger version of [[Krush]] (the icecrusher), twice the size (4x4 files)

== Postpone to Milestone 3 ==

These are items that can be postponed until milestone 3, but are still welcome for milestone 2.

===Code Tasks===
* separate lisp reader, tinygettext and other libraries properly out of SuperTux

===Editor / Developer Conveniences===
* optimize the build process, building SuperTux currently takes ages (I don't see how we could speed it up..., MatzeB)

===Levels / Scripting / Gameplay===
* fix console command set_game_speed() so that it doesn't slow down the console
* replace "you found a secret area" with a special sound (Wansti)
**why I like it the way it is. -ctdabomb
* General: Do something about the walking speed, feels wrong at the moment, maybe a bit slower
===Other===
* create SuperTux .xo Activity for OLPC (Grumbel)
* Have particle throwing starting enemies (fireflower like)
* add sprite scaling

== Finished ==
* document the behaviour of all badguys to be used in Milestone2 along with how they interact with each other - [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Enemies]]
* reorganize the editor to something more like this [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/68413a9004b402c38a8dd24bf785e2f0-supertux-editor-mockup.png SuperTux-Editor MookUp]
* Editor: show tile attributes in editor, especially for non-solid and unisolid there is often a very similar solid tile. Either add special editor-images for unisolid, some overlay icon for the tile selector <strike>or at least a hint in the status bar</strike>. (status bar done)
* General: Get rid of enemies stacking on top of each other
** <small>What does that mean? —[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:45, 9 March 2010 (UTC)</small>
** <small>I'm not sure if this issue still exists, but when one badguy falls on top of another and can't move left or right he will get stuck on top. - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 16:53, 19 March 2010 (UTC)</small>
* SuperTux should stand on the ground when a level starts, not fall down (move all spawnpoints to 1 tile above ground)
* paint tutorial board for backflip
* draw a bigger arrow for when Tux is jumping out of the screen
** [[https://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Image:Airarrow.png]]
* Create more music tracks for IcyIsland or add BlastOffTek's pack or the music by semaJD [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=875].
**semajd's music is added, we just need to add the music to levels
* [[Mr. IceBlock]]: transparency looks horrible on dark backgrounds, Wiki had a better looking version floating around
* [[Haywire]]: new bomb type (crazy pink bomb) that runs around after being touched
** Initial version is done. Waiting for feedback and improvements. See [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Enemies]] --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:08, 5 March 2010 (UTC)
* [[Mr. Bomb]]: Roll back to behavior of [[Milestone 1]], get rid of particle effects
** Particle effects are currently deactivated in [[Template:SvnFile|src/object/explosion.cpp]]. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:08, 5 March 2010 (UTC)
* add PNG support for screenshots, BMP support currently broken
** <small>What's wrong with BMP support? It seems to work for me - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 06:11, 13 June 2008 (UTC)</small>
*** ACK, BMP-based screenshots work, at least with the SDL renderer. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 06:53, 5 March 2010 (UTC)
* at large resolutions frame rate starts to sucks, but CPU usage continues to stay very low, is that a artifact of GPU use or something wrong with our timing/frameskipping code?
** <small>Fixed?</small>
* bug: can't walk left and jump while pressing ctrl, when going right the same works, might be keyboard specific (Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 USB suffers from it, on the same PC a PS/2 keyboard works, maybe kernel driver bug), capslock is bound to ctrl and ctrl is bound as action key, using space for action works as workaround (Grumbel)
* peeking should stick instead of jumping back or jumping back should be limited to normal range that the camera can do
** <small>I think this is fixed or at least better now? - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 18:34, 30 April 2009 (UTC)</small>
* <strike>add an cmd option --default</strike> and/or a menu entry "Reset to Default" to reset any changes to resolution or aspect ratio (or something along those lines) (cmd done, WolfgangB)

:No, that is on purpose: Tux can't run when carrying heavy objects. So you can control where the player can not bring eg. the trampoline without a artificial "no stuff behind this line" object.

= Milestone_2_Design_Document%2FTimeline =

[[Template:Navbox Milestone 2 Design Document]]
Most releases have been in December on or near the 25th. The current goal is to get something cool, playable, and user-friendly out by then.
The tasks are split into 3 phases, one for each month, though not necessarily in the order.

== Phase A - Graphics (October?) ==
The ice tileset needs more variety. The current is a good start, but more types of plants are needed. Decorative glaciers, more things trapped in ice, molds, tundra, unisolid tile variants, and ice spikes should get created, so that levels can include them. The forest tileset has twice as many tiles as the ice world does, so copy if needed ideas from there. Also, fix the slope tiles.

== Phase B – Levels (November?) ==
Once some tiles are added, people can start making pretty levels with ideas from all the previous ones. Reuse freely but don't constrain because the original had limited height. The [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Styleguide|Styleguide]] should be followed. Levels should be more than 60 tiles wide and more than 38 tiles tall to support the largest screen resolution we want to have. (1920 x 1200) As many levels as possible should be created so that we can mash ideas together and improve upon them.

== Phase C – Code (Anytime) ==
Various bugs have been uncovered and need to be fixed, so people can create parallax backgrounds and other useful designs. Ice tiles should get implemented so Tux can skid around. We might want slope-sliding, except that requires OBB's...
Some new enemy behaviors should be added so people can have variety in playing.

== Other Phases ==
Some other phases exist that aren't key to playing the game or creating content for it:

== Phase D – Sounds and Music (Before release) ==
The skid sound, grow-up, and some others don't sound quite in line with the rest. They should get tuned up to sound better... The music is also rather monotonous, as there are only 3 or so songs that levels can use. More could/should get created...

== Phase E – Editor (Before level phase begins) ==
Some people have lots of trouble running the C# editor, as evidenced by the large numbers (22) of bugs resulting in the complete inability to edit and create levels. Either some other language should be used, or a full-time support team (person?) should be around...

[[Template:Navbox Milestone 2 Design Document]]
= Menu System =

Menu system of Milestone1 is rather ugly and could need a rewrite as well as a reorganization of some things:

* displaying the level name in/above/below the pause menu would be nice
* there should be an option to display the full GPL in the menu
* the menu system shall use icons to make it easier to find things even with no reading skills

== Profile ==

* Create new profile
* Delete profile
* Profile1 -> Main Menu
* Profile2 -> Main Menu
* ...

== Options == 

* Language
* Fullscreen: yes/no
* Fullscreen Resolution: 800x600, 1024x768, ... (automatic list from SDL)
* Magnification: 100% (pixel perfect), 75%, 50%, ..., Full Screen (zoom till the screen is filled), Letterbox (zoom till all of the 1280x800 game area is visible)
* Aspect Ratio: 16/9, 16/10, 5/4, 4/3
* Sound Volume: off/0-100
* Music Volume: off/0-100
* Setup Keyboard:
* Setup Joystick:
* Use Profiles: yes/no

== Contrib Levels ==

* Check for new stuff online
* complete contrib worlds
* browse folders with level stuff

= Configuration =

The games configuration (fullscreen, aspect ratio, geometry, etc.) shouldn't be saved when supplied by command line.

[[Template:Navbox Milestone 2 Design Document]]
__TOC__

This document is meant to give a reasonably detailed guide on what shall and shall not happen in Milestone&nbsp;2. It is also intended as a complete replacement of other, incomplete or otherwise flawed, Milestone&nbsp;2 documents floating around in this Wiki. This design document is written by [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]], question and comments are welcome, use the [[Talk:Milestone 2 Design Document|talk page]] or the [[IRC]] channel for that. At the moment this document is a work-in-progress, meaning goals might change as time progresses. This document has not yet been approved by any other member of the ''SuperTux'' [[Team|development staff]].

= Motivation = 

Development of the forest world hasn't made much progress over the last few years. Milestone&nbsp;2 is a try to bring development back up to speed by setting more reasonable goals and by cutting out a lot of allocated cruft, reducing the game back to a maintainable state that allows further development. This means the [[Forest|forest world]] will be cut out completely and focus will be given to the [[Iceworld]] of [[Milestone 1]]. The core goals of Milestone 2 are:

* cleanup the engine and fix long standing issues (broken OpenGL texturing, broken collision detection, etc)
* enhance and adopt the levels of [[Milestone 1]] to use new engine features
* stabilize the engine to the point that new stable released can be rolled out much faster
* create a polished boss fight

Optional goals (might wait for [[Milestone 3]]):

* create new levels, tile sets and enemies

The Milestone 2 Design Document lists a lot of additional features for the iceworld, which should maybe wait till the next release.

= General =

* uni-solid tiles shall be provided for all tilesets
*: Should the graphics of unisolid tiles differ from those of solid tiles? If not, using invisible unisolid tiles in the interactive tilemap and solid tiles in a non-solid background tilemap works just as well and doesn't duplicate tiles a hundredfold. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:06, 2 March 2010 (UTC)
* multi-layer parallax scrolling background tilemaps shall be used in all levels
* menu system should be replaced/reworked
* save system could need a rework as well
* language shall be changeable via the option menu, LANG environment variable shall only be used as default setting
*: I think this is how it is currently behaving, isn't it? --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:06, 2 March 2010 (UTC)
* worldmap Tux sprite should get animations for left, right, up, down directions, not just a single one as now

= Levels = 

The levels of Milestone1 lack verticality as well as unisolid tiles, Milestone2 should fix that by adding those elements. Also the levels should be shortened/split to avoid the need for reset points. Another important point is that each level should try follow a clear design premise instead of being more or less random collection of tiles and enemies. The levels from Milestone1 should be taken as a point of inspiration and starting point, not as something that is verbatim copied over to Milestone2. 

The ''worldmap'' should be rolled back to that of [[Milestone 1]], i.e. a mostly linear map, but additional optional paths shall be added.
: This has been done in [[Template:Revision|6424]] and is included in this form in ''version 0.3.3''. The only additional path is to the bonus level, though. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:12, 2 March 2010 (UTC)

See [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Levels]] for a more detailed analysis of the current levels.

== Cleanup ==

The test/ levels are currently quite a big mess, there needs to be cleanup to reduce them to those that are really needed otherwise its to easy to miss the ones that are important.
: [[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] has cleaned up test levels a bit in [[Template:Revision|6477]]. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:09, 2 March 2010 (UTC)

= World 1 - Icyisland =

World 1, the icyisland, was released with Milestone 1, the intend of Milestone 2 is to adapt it to the new engine features as well as improving it by adding new enemies and new gameplay elements. While level structure might be recyclable in many places, it will often need structural improvements to provide real use of vertical and horizontal scrolling, instead of just locking the player in a horizontal-only scrolling level. Things that need to be done:
[[Image:Newpipe_blue.png|thumbnail|right|New Pipe Variations]]
* Jumpy shall be replaced with an enemy that fits better into the snow landscape, Jumpy himself shall be reused in a lava-like setting or in the bosses castle
*: Are you referring to the old ''Milestone 1'' jumpy? The current snowball-with-a-spring look fits the snowy landscape well, IMHO. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:18, 2 March 2010 (UTC)
* the walrus salesmen shall be added to the island
* some levels shall be separated out into optional paths, to provide a less linear path
* iceblocks which will melt on contact with fire shall allow to lock paths in a level or lock secrets
*: Code is there, see [[weak block]]s. Needs graphics to fit into [[Icy Island]]. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:18, 2 March 2010 (UTC)
* balanced platforms that start to rotate or move when Tux stands on them shall be provided
* water, in its simplistic tile form, shall be removed from all levels
* uni-solid/half-tiles shall be used to enhance the levels and provide optional paths
* bottom-less pits shall be either replaced by pits with spike at the bottom or allow Tux to climb back out of the pit

* there shall be auto-scrolling levels that force Tux to run by having a avalanche coming down behind him, the avalanche might either be simple snow or a large group of enemies
* the castle tileset shall be replaced with something that looks colder and features both snow and ice
* cave tileset shall be replaced with something that has a larger pattern, thus looks less ugly when tiled
* tiles picturing deadly spikes build out of ice shall be created

<br clear="all" />

= Intro/Credits =
[[Image:Introcutscene.png|thumbnail|left|Intro Storyboard]]
The text based intro and credits shall be replaced with cutscenes, showing the events that are described in the text. Instead of auto-scrolling text the game shall provide text that doesn't scroll, but instead only continues up on user interaction (i.e. press action button to see the next page of text). Text in cutscenes shall get printed letter by letter to the screen to provide a sense of 'motion'. Voice over from a story-teller might be consideration, while Tux, Penny and Nolok itself shall remain without speech.

'''Later in the development of Milestone2'''

= Things to know =

* [[Template:SvnFile|data/levels/test/unisolid.stl]] shows a few new features of Milestone&nbsp;2 (parallax scrolling, unisolid snow tiles, new water)
* [[News]] is there to be used, so if something interesting happens, write it down there
