The '''Owl''' is a [[badguy]] from the [[Milestone 2 Design Document]]. It flies high up in the air and carries badguys around. When Tux is below it, it will drop whatever it is carrying.

This badguy is in the [[SVN]] repository since [[Template:Revision|6558]].
The graphics for this badguy still need to be improved. The graphics currently in SVN are colorized versions of the concept graphics, basically.
