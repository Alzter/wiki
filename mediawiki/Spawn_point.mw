'''Spawn points''' are the places where [[Tux]] appears when entering a level or a sector. Every sector has a ''main'' spawn point, the one where Tux begins the level, but there may be as many spawn points as the level designer wishes, usable to spawn Tux when he enters a [[door]] or touches a [[script trigger]].

You can use the global ''Level'' object to spawn Tux at a specific spawn point. The syntax is as follows:
 Level.spawn ("SecretArea", "main");
Where “SecretArea” is the name of the [[sector]] and “main” is the name of the spawn point.
