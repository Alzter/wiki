:''This page is about the worldmap object. For teleportation in levels see [[Door]] and [[ScriptingLevel|Level (Scripting)]].''
A '''teleport''' is an [[objects|object]] on [[worldmap]]s that teleports the player to another part of the map. Teleporters are used primarily to hide secret levels or to link between islands. ''Bonus world&nbsp;1'' uses them extensively; navigation is not possible without the use of teleporters. There are currently two teleporters in [[Icy Island]] ''(World&nbsp;1)'';one is an automatic one to go to [[Forest]] ''(World 2)'', and the other is used to access the bonus level. In the ''Forest'' world there currently is only one automatic teleporter to go back to ''Icy Island''.
