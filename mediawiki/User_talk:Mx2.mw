Can I edit SuperTux (from top to bottom, free ...) and then redistribute it under another name (like SuperTux Advance ...) on the Hosts file (therefore free to download)?
: If you want to make changes to SuperTux and then redistribute it, I think it would be preferred by all developers (although I can only speak for myself) if you drop "SuperTux" from the name. It's ok to describe your game as "based on SuperTux", but calling it "SuperTux Advance" gives the impression that it's associated with SuperTux, which it's not. - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 15:33, 27 April 2010 (UTC)
