== Bots on the Wiki ==
Currently there is only one bot roaming the wiki:
* [[User:AnMasterBot|AnMasterBot]] - a wiki cleanup bot run by [[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]]


== Use of Bots on the wiki ==
Bots cause the wiki much strain and therefore you will not be allowed to run one unless you got one that does something useful for the wiki that no other bot does yet. This includes all archival bots used to archive websites.

If you feel you can make, or have made, a bot for the wiki that will be beneficial please contact [[User talk:AnMaster|AnMaster on his talk page]] or any other SuperTux developer to ask for permission.
