'''GSprite''' is a future tool to edit .sprite files, as suggested on [[Grumbel grumbles]]. Based on the Python programming language and using the GTK+ libraries, it will be designed to run on a GNOME-based Linux platform (or any Linux system with Python, GTK, and PyGTK installed, really), and come with a library for loading and saving sprite files. Currently, this library is under development.
