I'd love to see a version of SuperTux for my sharp zaurus. 

I downloaded a Linux LiveCD 'Zaurus Development Environment 1.0' fpr my PC, but don't know where to go from there.

My Z's 320x240 display is what the low-end PC specs were using...and it's a passable pocket-sized linux based pc...which I've only barely begun to use to its potential.

The 640x480 Zaurus models are much more expensive in the US. It won't be soon that I invest in one.

I've read tutorials for cross-compiling...there are some libraries people have gathered to ease the process. 

I just need a push in the right direction.
