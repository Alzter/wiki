My name is UltraTux, and I am currently working on designing pictures and stories for a SuperTux moderation I shall make called either Ultra-Tux or Super Lemons, because Tux will be lightning-yellow. I may also release Mega-Tux or Super Limes, because of his Sour Green color in those games. Mainly here just in case anyone has questions about my game plans, and to write user ideas. I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PROGRAMMING (YET) so please don't talk extremely complicated :) ;)
