Magic Blocks are tile-like game objects that are sensitive to [[Lighting]] conditions. They are rendered in a primary color and will only be (uni-)solid as long as light of the same color shines on the block.

This might be implemented by having light-emitting objects (e.g. a [[Flame]] Badguy emitting yellow light) inherit from a new class called LightSource. This class provides a LightSource::update() method that gets called from the derived object's update method. 

It will then take care of rendering a colored point light to the lightmap and calling the set_solid(bool) methods of nearby Magic Blocks as needed.
