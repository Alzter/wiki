Development is mainly coordinated via IRC and the mailing list. Be sure to visit both once in a while if you do not want to miss critical stuff.

## Mailing lists

* <supertux-devel@lists.lethargik.org>: List for comments, criticisms and everything development related.
  - [Archive](http://lists.lethargik.org/pipermail/supertux-devel-lethargik.org)
  - [Subscribe/unsubscribe](http://lists.lethargik.org/listinfo.cgi/supertux-devel-lethargik.org)

* <supertux-commit@lists.lethargik.org>: List for commits to the Git repository, mainly useful for people working directly with the source.
  - [Archive](http://lists.lethargik.org/pipermail/supertux-commit-lethargik.org)

## IRC

If you want slightly faster, live answers to your questions, you are free to join our IRC channel `#supertux`, hosted on [chat.freenode.net](ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697). If no one answers, please don't just leave but try to wait for someone to read your questions. Do note that by joining, you agree that everything you say is logged publicly [here](http://stux.logular.com/). If you don't have an IRC client installed, you can also use freenode's [webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=supertux&uio=d4).
