A bubble dispenser is a device that, when activated, creates bubbles that slowly float upward. Tux can jump into one of these bubbles to get upward movement; he is also able to control floating speed and movement to the sides a bit. Bubbles are destroyed on contact with solid tiles or objects, whereupon Tux is released. The following sketch shows such a bubble dispenser as it could appear in the forest world, in form of a fossilized dragon that starts spitting bubbles as soon as Tux "wakes" him by jumping on his nose.
