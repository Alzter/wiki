Well, umm, hi.. I don't really know where to post this, but this is game development so.. I guess i'll post it here.. Anyway, I have created a sort of mod for Supertux, nothing special, just editing of the sprites and images to give the game a different feel. I made my theme firey and somewhat hellish and I apologise if that offends anyone. I attempted to e-mail the creator of Supertux some time ago, though I did not recieve an reply so.. here I am. Well what I was wondering is if any of you would like to place the mod on the Supertux homepage for people to download. If your interested let me know either by replying to this post or e-mailing me at Zypher_312@hotmail.com

Thanks,
Tony

Why don't you just e-mail the supertux-devel@lists.berlios.de mailing list that all developers read? Also it would be a good idea to upload your stuff somewhere so that we can actually take a look or have something to link to?


Well, I didn't know about the developer e-mail list, so I guess I'll try that. For the link I don't really know how to put a download link for everyone to access and download, but I will send the mod to all the developers via e-mail.

Thanks, Tony

I like the limpy, it would be neat to have a tunnel crawling with them going in every direction. Would be crazy :) . -F50

== Squirrel/(mini)SWIG and S-Lang? ==

Seems wasteful to have two scripting languages (plus a binding tool). Why not (like myweb.cableone.net/gmcnutt/nazghul.html Nazghul) just use something ala TinySCHEME for all the scripting?

We just use the scheme-expressions as a flexible tree-based file format (the atlernative would have been 
xml parsers which are bigger and the scheme is a bit nicer to read in our opinions). But the scheme stuff is not a scripting language in supertux. --[[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]] 12:05, 19 Jul 2006 (BST)

== "3D Tux" ==

I like the fact I can run this game on old machines without needing special hardware.
Please... pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease... keep it 2D.
If 3D is going to be for cutscenes only, please make sure it's possible to disable them, ok?

thanks

:Yeah, I second that... on my (brandnew) laptop only the "nogl" version will run (no hardware acceleration available). I very much hope that a "nogl" version will be available in the future, too... --[[User:87.8.234.242|87.8.234.242]] 19:57, 27 January 2008 (UTC)

::They still sell cards without hardware acceleration? Can't believe that. How will it be "Vista Capable TM" that way? Or do you mean you can't get hardware acceleration working in Linux?

:::Apparently they do... at any rate, the guy who sold me the machine claims that it doesn't have hw acceleration (Intel 945 GM chipset). --[[User:134.34.147.22|134.34.147.22]] 16:38, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

== Be able to jump again if jumped on an enemy ==

Hi!

I hope i didn't read over it, but wouldn't it be fine if the Character would be able to jump again after being jumped upon an enemy?
Because, if an enemy is flying above an abyss, and I jump on it, i'll fall into that abyss. There, it would be fineto be able to jump again (if jumped on an enemy) to rescue oneself from falling down.

HTH, pktm

:In which version is it not possible to jump again? Usually Tux bounces off an enemy when jumping on it. --[[User:204.13.236.244|204.13.236.244]] 13:08, 20 April 2008 (UTC)

:: I'm using supertux 0.3.0-0 on a openSuse 10.3 x86_64. Edit: I checked it. The Character bounces off the enemy, if it just jumps on it. But if you press the jump key while jumping on an anemy, you fall down.
