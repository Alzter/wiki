Well, umm, hi.. I don't really know where to post this, but this is game development so.. I guess i'll post it here.. Anyway, I have created a sort of mod for Supertux, nothing special, just editing of the sprites and images to give the game a different feel. I made my theme firey and somewhat hellish and I apologise if that offends anyone. I attempted to e-mail the creator of Supertux some time ago, though I did not recieve an reply so.. here I am. Well what I was wondering is if any of you would like to place the mod on the Supertux homepage for people to download. If your interested let me know either by replying to this post or e-mailing me at Zypher_312@hotmail.com

Thanks,
Tony

Why don't you just e-mail the supertux-devel@lists.berlios.de mailing list that all developers read? Also it would be a good idea to upload your stuff somewhere so that we can actually take a look or have something to link to?


Well, I didn't know about the developer e-mail list, so I guess I'll try that. For the link I don't really know how to put a download link for everyone to access and download, but I will send the mod to all the developers via e-mail.

Thanks, Tony
