Features which we will target for Milestone 2:

* replace the Intro text with an [[Story|intro cutscene]]
* [[Yeti]] will be added as the final boss on the [[Icyisland]]
* the [[Forest]] tileset will be mainly used on the second island
* new BadGuys
* 15-30 new levels
* Back- and Verticalscrolling, in short full scrolling in all directions
* tilemap based backgrounds, no more screensizest png/jpegs
* New actions: [[Buttjump]], [[Flapping]]
* support for [[Sectors|sectors]] (sublevels)
* Non-square tiles [[hills]], maybe the [[Slider|sliding]] action
* Info-boxes that present a dialog-window on jump would be good to teach the player new moves and actions - completed
* IceFlower and FireFlower should get more specifc meaning and abilities
* better input configurations, joystick buttons should be useable as axis and vice versa, really a must have since some joypads give button events for the directional pad
* all singe-file tile should be merged into larger groups, this will speed up the loading quite a bit, since the png overhead is quite large
