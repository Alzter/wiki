The following is a list of defects in Milestone1, these are not bugs, but things that are annoying, missing or otherwise out of place and should be changed or fixed in Milestone2 or later:

* bitmap backgrounds look very boring, not only do they not paralax scroll, but they also simply repeat the tileset that is used for the foreground

* MrBomb looks sucky

* Tux lacks a dedicated run animation

* Run-sign should be replaced with an info block

* keyboard configuration via menu is very fishy, ie. not navigatable via the keyboard but only via mouse, since otherwise one changes all the settings, kind of non-intuitive

* MrIceblocks black outline looks out of place

* pipes look ugly

* green grass tiles don't fit very well into the theme, large grass tile is to large

* tiles are seperated in files, this causes beside other things slower load times

* loading of level header information is rather slow (ie. starting the worldmap)

* environment is, beside from the ?-blocks, completly non-animated -> boring

* bumping against a ?-block leaves the ?-block graphic in place sometimes

* one-tile gaps are handled pretty badly

* ?-blocks don't indicate at which side they where bumped

* goal-bars look kind of pointless (bad ripoff of MarioWorld)

* Worldmap doesn't have basically no alternative paths

* no fade-in/out when you enter a level or die

* snowflakes, while pretty, don't really match the style

* coins look shit

* stay-on-platform is fishy, should be indicated by the enemies color

* ?-blocks are badly shaped (pixel dirt)

* stalacticts should shatter via particle effects

* lives are rather pointless, since one can continue as one wish

* game 'physics' are to simple, making game to easy in many areas

* many badguys don't align properly to the tilemap

* level design rather uninspried, many screens are completly pointless and without challange

* many enemies simply fall into the next hole without ever being any danger to tux

* grey-blocks are super ugly

* igloo should have a flag raised or something other to indicate that Tux entered it

* no half-tiles/unisolid tiles

* invisible blocks have collision even when they are invisible

* coins and other stuff should have particle-effect or other animation when collected, not just dissapear

* many secret areas look like bugs

* flying snowball could need more animation, moving eyes, smoke coming from an exhaust, etc

* no seperate death animation for flying snowball

* music on the worldmap doesn't fit

* worldmap is non-animated and lacks water animation

* water in levels is pointless

* 'excelent' sound sample sucks

* fireflower-Tux looks shit, shooting fireballs looks shit as well (just poping out of Tux's head)

* levels are to long, shorter more focused onces would be better

* enemies move to slow in relation to Tux, make them to easily dodge able

* MrBomb explosion should be particle effects

== Fixed in Milestone2 ==

* no back/horizontal/vertical scrolling 

* reset points are invisible
