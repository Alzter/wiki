The following is a list of defects in Milestone1. These are not bugs, but rather things that are annoying, missing or otherwise out of place and should be changed or fixed in Milestone2.x:

* Bitmap backgrounds look very boring, not only do they not paralax scroll (meaning multiple background layers scrolling at different speeds), but they also simply repeat the tileset that is used for the foreground.

* Mr Bomb is poorly drawn.

* Tux lacks a dedicated run animation.

* The Run sign should be replaced with an information block.

* The keyboard configuration via the menu is very awkward. It is only navigatable with the mouse (not the keyboard); it's kind of non-intuitive.

* The black outline surrounding Mr Ice Block looks out of place.

* The pipes look poorly drawn.

* The green grass tiles are out of place, and the large one is too large.

* The tiles are seperated in different files; besides other things, this causes slower load times.

* The level header information loading process is rather slow (ie. launching the worldmap).

* Besides the ? blocks, the environment is completly inanimate; this causes the game to be slightly less exciting.

* In some cases, bumping against a ? block leaves the image in place.

* One-tile gaps are handled pretty badly.

* ?-blocks don't indicate at which side they where bumped - MatzeB: IMO being able to bounce ? blocks from 2 sides to affect direction of the egg was a pointless feature anyway... Grumbel: it was pointless without backscrolling, with backscrolling however I consider it pretty essential, it should simply be a bit more obvious (block jumping/rotating into the direction it was bumped)

* The goal bars are pointless (a ripoff of Mario World).

* Worldmaps have basically no alternative paths.

* There are no fade-outs/ins when you either die or complete a level.

* While pretty, the snowflakes do not really match the style.

* The coins are very poorly drawn.

* The enemy's stay-on-platform option is questionable; it should be indicated by the enemy's color.

* The ? blocks are badly shaped.

* Stalactites should shatter via particle effects.

* The physics of the game are too simple; making the game too easy in many areas.

* many badguys don't align properly to the tilemap

* level design rather uninspried, many screens are completly pointless and without challange

* many enemies simply fall into the next hole without ever being any danger to tux

* grey-blocks are super ugly

* igloo should have a flag raised or something other to indicate that Tux entered it

* no half-tiles/unisolid tiles

* invisible blocks have collision even when they are invisible

* coins and other stuff should have particle-effect or other animation when collected, not just dissapear

* many secret areas look like bugs

* flying snowball could need more animation, moving eyes, smoke coming from an exhaust, etc

* no seperate death animation for flying snowball

* music on the worldmap doesn't fit

* worldmap is non-animated and lacks water animation

* water in levels is pointless

* 'excelent' sound sample sucks

* fireflower-Tux looks shit, shooting fireballs looks shit as well (just poping out of Tux's head)

* levels are to long, shorter more focused onces would be better

* enemies move to slow in relation to Tux, make them to easily dodge able

* MrBomb explosion should be particle effects

* Main Menu background with the dumb auto-jump Tux sucks, should be a clever Tux

* Slots shouldn't be limited to five, might be better to have a 'create slot', 'copy slot', 'delete slot' menu entry

* the blinking pause effect is shit (epileptic fun), having pause at all seems pointless, since we already have a menu

* the starting point, the igloo on the worldmap, is not enterable

* pipes can't be entered and thus we had no bonus rooms

* 'clever' enemies are missing, something like the plants which go out of a pipe only if Mario is not standing on that pipe

* menu fade-in is so so, better than nothing, but not that great either

* no die jingle music

* you shouldn't be allowed to exit a level while you are jumping - this is only important if you consider lives to be an important game concept

* fireball power isn't very interesting, and makes the game far too simple.  Game could benefit from more powers, and more interesting ones.

* Custom worldmaps are not visible in the Custom Level dialog, should probally have their own menu 

* Time continues to run in the end sequence, all UI should however fade away in cutscenes

* highlighted menu entry is hard to figure out in menus with only two entries (ie. its unclear which color is the highlighted one)

* game could need some font effects, active menu entry could woople or so

* enemies should be animate when throw/shoot (rotate around z-axis or so)

* lack of monster-generators (ie. objects that constantly spawn new enemies)

* the breakable blocks are sometimes covered with snow and sometimes not, this is basically randomly

* the particles that get thrown after one hit a breakable block look weird (not reacting to gravity and there surface seems to change)

== Fixed in Milestone2 ==

* no back/horizontal/vertical scrolling 

* reset points are invisible
