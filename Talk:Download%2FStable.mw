== Remove the Debian/Ubuntu header! ==

Ubuntu doesn't have the stable version of SuperTux anymore. Until the [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/supertux/+bug/84084 situation is clarified], remove the header, or at least add a warning notice.
:Done, added warning on 0.3.0 download page. You should've posted this under the Milestone 1.9 download talk though, it would make more sense. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 04:57, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

== Supertux on GameCube ==

Looks like they ported Supertux on cube, look:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98581&package_id=181273

==Mac OS X==

It is Mac OS X, not Mac OS/X. OS/X sounds awfully like OS/2.
:GNU/Linux? SCNR.
