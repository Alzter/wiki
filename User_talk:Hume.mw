== Licenses ==

The licenses are required so that SuperTux can be included in the Debian distribution. They won't accept non-free content, and if there's no licensing information it's assumed to be non-free. IIRC, many of the original sounds were from "royalty-free" sound fx sites, which are free-as-in-beer but often don't allow derivative works or some of the other rights Debian requires.
