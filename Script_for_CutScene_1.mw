[scene begins showing the icefields, camera moves left to show Tux and Penny having picnic.]
Penny: what a lovely day.
Tux: yes it is, this was a great idea of yours to have a picnic,
Penny: Why thank you Tux, you are sweet
(Tux Blushes)
Tux: heh want to see me dance?
Penny: erm..
Tux: ok then
Penny: er..
Tux: Ready?
Penny: ..
(some kind of hard to understand rap(?))
(big woosh, smoke/darkness(or something))
(in the darkness) Penny: wahhhh | Tux: oompft
Tux: oh my head, what was that Penny?
Tux: Penny??
Tux: PENNY WHERE ARE YOU?
Tux: Wait a minute what's this? and why am I talking to myself?
(Tux skip reads letter)
Tux: Oh my I must rescue penny...
[a seal appears]
Seal: yeah and stop talking to yourself
[the seal goes away]
[end scene]
