''What happens to existing levels, especially in situations where the water is on the bottom of a shaft with no way to climb out?'' - how about Tux having a limited air supply?
:Guybrush Threepwood can hold his breath for ten minutes. A penguin should do even better. And that is longer than anyone wants to stare at the same supertux level. So unlimited air supply should be okay. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 14:38, 17 Aug 2006 (BST)
