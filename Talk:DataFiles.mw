For all the sounds we have, I think we should edit the Vorbis comments accordingly to be able to discern what was made by who. The music is mostly done. <nowiki>~~</nowiki>[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 20:05, 4 Jan 2007 (CET)

Instead of just putting "made by self", etc, please put which licence(s) you would like to release the file under. I would recommend using GPLv2 + CC-by-sa where possible. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 20:52, 4 Jan 2007 (CET)
:If I contribute something to a GPL project (eg by sending it to a project member or or uploading it myself) doesn't that automatically make my stuff GPL, too? So why add it again?
