'''Spawn points''' are the places where [[Tux]] appears when entering a level or a sector. Every sector has a ''main'' spawn point, the one where Tux begins the level, but there may be as many spawn points as the level designer wishes, usable to spawn Tux when he enters a [[door]] or touches a [[script trigger]].
