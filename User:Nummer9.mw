Welcome on my ultimate userpage !

I'm a supertux-player since 2006. I hope, that supertux get a better game.

I can't code in C++ for Supertux, but I know how to code some gadgets in C. I'm using python and PHP frequently and I want to help Supertux by developing, but I don't know what I can't do and how.

* btw: I'm from germany, so my English is realy crap.

: Hello and welcome to the SuperTux Wiki. Writing C++ code is not the only way of helping out with the development -- by far! Have a look at the [[SuperTux FAQ]] to get an impression of the many things the developers need help with.
:: Hi ! That sounds good. I can design levels and I have already made a great Forest-Level. Can I help Supertux by giving some levels ?--[[User:Nummer9|Nummer9]] 19:20, 20 May 2007 (UTC)
