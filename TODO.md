This is a list of issues that are outstanding, or resource requests which are
not major enough to warrant an issue report. It would be nice to have
contributions for tasks with high priority (as seen in issue tags) to be submitted
first, but it's not strictly neccessary.

Please have a look at our issue tracker on GitHub where you can also find
issues by `category:` tags (e.g.: `category:design` for graphics/UX tasks,
`category:code` for code tasks, and `category:levels` for level design tasks).
