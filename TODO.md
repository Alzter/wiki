This is a list of tasks and issues that might be worth to implement or fix, however it is not an authoritative list of things that must be done, it is a collection of random things popping up during development. Thus not everything in here might be well thought out or really worth to implement. Use your brain before implementing anything on this list and always think about how useful a new feature would be in the context of the whole game or if a potential performance enhancement, actually enhances anything at all. 

The list is incomplete and is just a rough outline, but it does feature some of our bigger issues.
