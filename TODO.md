This is a centralized list of things that need to be done. It is maintained by
the SuperTux development team. It can include issues that are outstanding, or
resource requests. The document will also be used to track decisions on these
issues and requests.

Please have a look at our issue tracker on GitHub where you can also find
issues by `category:` tags (e.g.: `category:design` for graphics/UX tasks,
`category:code` for code tasks, and `category:levels` for level design tasks).
