Did we actually use any fishes in [[Icyisland]]? - sik0fewl

Not that I've seen, maybe should add some? Seems to me World1 should still be improved (i.e. add more paths) - zratchet

No, I think we should leave World1 as-is, except for a boss and maybe minibosses. - sik0fewl

I removed [[Fish]] from [[Icyisland]] list - sik0fewl

I don't think a cactus really fits in with the forest theme, it's more of a desert thing. - sik0fewl

both dillos and cacti are in the jungle. I've read about it. - zratchet

Personally I think that World1 is far too long and too hard, especially if we want to add more levels. Also, it's too SMB1-ish (monotonous). - NabsS
