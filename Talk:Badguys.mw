Did we actually use any fishes in [[Icyisland]]? - sik0fewl

Not that I've seen, maybe should add some? Seems to me World1 should still be improved (i.e. add more paths) - zratchet

No, I think we should leave World1 as-is, except for a boss and maybe minibosses. - sik0fewl

I removed [[Fish]] from [[Icyisland]] list - sik0fewl

I don't think a cactus really fits in with the forest theme, it's more of a desert thing. - sik0fewl

both dillos and cacti are in the jungle. I've read about it. - zratchet

Personally I think that World1 is far too long and too hard, especially if we want to add more levels. Also, it's too SMB1-ish (monotonous). - NabsS

: Please be more constructive in your criticism. If you found it monotonous, supply ideas on how to make it more interesting. It's better to have a goal to work towards instead of only having something to avoid...

==Standardization?==
Looking around, I noticed that badguys' data is a bit messy. What about a template like this?

'''Badguy name'''

'''Game sprite:''' picture of the badguy

'''Found in:''' Icyisland, Light Forest and so on

'''Behaviour:''' basic behaviour, like "Walks around", "Jumps" and so on

'''Squishable:''' yes or no, plus effects triggered by squishing (like Mr.Tree's and Mr. Iceblock's)

'''"Butt-Jumpable":''' effect when Butt-Jumped (maybe with another label...)

'''Freezable: '''effect on contact with IceBullet (e.g. for Mr Bomb this would be something like "Yes. Can be carried when frozen")

'''Burnable: '''effect on contact with FireBullet, Lava and so on

Voices like ''Implemented since MS 1/2'' and ''Current status: implemented/to be implemented/proposed/rejected'' might also be useful.

: Having such a template would really be great. Maybe it could even be a Wiki Template. Now all that left to do is finding someone willing to apply the template ;-)

It works now, see [[Template:Badguy]]. Use it as <nowiki>{{</nowiki>badguy|''badguy name''|''image name''|''found in''|''behaviour''|''squishable''|''buttjumpable''|''freezable''|''burnable''<nowiki>}}</nowiki>. Italic parts are variable. -Shylence
