= Task List =

* optimize the build process, building SuperTux currently takes ages
* change game back to use Milestone1 single-sprite SuperTux (done)
* do a 32x32 top-down water animation for the worldmap
* Tux isn't centered properly to his collision box
* [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0400.pdf Cyrillic Font]

*:http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/6a7e3ff759ad7ca802ec8fcb2e96b9e5-supertux-rus-files2.tar.bz2
* seperate lisp reader, tinygettext and other libraries properly out of SuperTux
* write TexturePacker to place multiple images on a single texture (better use of texture space and fixes bug with tiles having junk on the edge)
* switch supertux-editor over to CMake? (done, is now a simple Makefile)
* reorganize the editor to something more like this [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/68413a9004b402c38a8dd24bf785e2f0-supertux-editor-mockup.png SuperTux-Editor MookUp]
* create a timeline what shall be done and when
* discuss in the meeting what shall be done over the coming week

= Bug List/Feature Requests =

* when BigTux ducks, the camera moves/jumps, but should stand still
* InfoBox crashes when Text doesn't start with a marker character
* there should be an script command to change the game speed (i.e. run in slowmotion)
* background graphics glitch at non-800x600 resolutions (black line where background tiles), reason for this is that background gets copied to a 1024x1024 texture with a black border, at non 800x600 resolutions the right edge becomes blended with this black border, need to add 1px border around the texture to fix this blending bug (alternative: use GL_NEAREST instead of GL_LINEAR)
* Tux isn't animated when he dies
