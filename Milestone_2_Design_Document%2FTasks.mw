[[Milestone 2 Design Document]]

= Task List =

* optimize the build process, building SuperTux currently takes ages
* change game back to use Milestone1 single-sprite SuperTux (done)
* do a 32x32 top-down water animation for the worldmap
* Tux isn't centered properly to his collision box

*:http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/6a7e3ff759ad7ca802ec8fcb2e96b9e5-supertux-rus-files2.tar.bz2
* seperate lisp reader, tinygettext and other libraries properly out of SuperTux
* write TexturePacker to place multiple images on a single texture (better use of texture space and fixes bug with tiles having junk on the edge)
* switch supertux-editor over to CMake? (done, is now a simple Makefile)
* reorganize the editor to something more like this [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/68413a9004b402c38a8dd24bf785e2f0-supertux-editor-mockup.png SuperTux-Editor MookUp]
* create a timeline what shall be done and when
* discuss in the meeting what shall be done over the coming week

= Bug List/Feature Requests =

* when BigTux ducks, the camera moves/jumps, but should stand still
* InfoBox crashes when Text doesn't start with a marker character
* there should be an script command to change the game speed (i.e. run in slowmotion)
* background graphics glitch at non-800x600 resolutions (black line where background tiles), reason for this is that background gets copied to a 1024x1024 texture with a black border, at non 800x600 resolutions the right edge becomes blended with this black border, need to add 1px border around the texture to fix this blending bug (alternative: use GL_NEAREST instead of GL_LINEAR)
* Tux isn't animated when he dies
* Editor: sort (new) layers by z-value

= Tasks for the next two weeks =

* finish canon graphics, also snowball graphics, death, etc (Grumbel)
* create ice-spikes graphics (Grumbel)
* create ice-tiles graphics (Grumbel)
* create angry ice-block graphics (Grumbel)
* bring back single-sprite SuperTux
* create an overview over the current levels (Grumbel)
* finish editor improvements (MatzeB)
* try to fix white-lines around graphics problems (MatzeB)
* jump with keyboard up (done, WolfgangB)


* repair jump Tux sprite (to dark black) (Grumbel)
* butt jump animation (Grumbel)
* backflip animation (Grumbel)
* snowman graphics (Grumbel)
* figure out a Jumpy replacement (Grumbel)
* create SuperTux .xo Activity for OLPC (Grumbel)
* some decore for ice tiles, cracks and stuff (Grumbel)
* replace "you found a secret area" with a special sound (Wansti)
* rename trunk/supertux-sharp to trunk/supertux-editor to make it clear that it is the primary editor (MatzeB)
* Stay-on-platform snowball (done, WolfgangB)
* snowball-launcher (done. WolfgangB)


* create proper background tiles for level22
* create some playable test levels for new stuff
* create mountain and night background
* replace old bomb with new bomb sprite
* create an enemy type that doesn't just walk straight into one direction, but does something different depending on Tux direction (ninja)
* integrate snowjumpy
* finish icecrusher graphics
* add some acceleration/deceleration to flying snowball


* deep snow tiles
* icicle graphics for decoration purpose
* editor doesn't align canon and icecrusher properly (grid is wrong)
* new enemy type with more interesting walking pattern (follows Tux as long as Tux doesn't look, walks forward and backward, etc.), see Crystallo for a possible sprite
* use pink snowball for stay on platform, use normal snowball for straight forward walk


* add a "scan for joysticks" to the "No Joysticks found" in "Setup Joystick" to allow hotplugging
* remove pictures from credits, looks to uneven that way
* animate minibomb


* paint tutorial boards for grabbing, backflip and run-jump
* add gamma control to the option menu, see: int SDL_SetGamma (float redgamma, float greengamma, float bluegamma);

* peeking should work in in both X and Y at the same time (for use with second analog stick on todays gamepads) (done, WolfgangB)

* add an cmd option --default and/or a menu entry "Reset to Default" to reset any changes to resolution or aspect ratio (or something along those lines)
