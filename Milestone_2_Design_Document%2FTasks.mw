{{Navbox Milestone 2 Design Document}}

{{nextversion}}

moved to: [[Planned features]]

== Finished ==
* document the behaviour of all badguys to be used in Milestone2 along with how they interact with each other - [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Enemies]]
* reorganize the editor to something more like this [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/68413a9004b402c38a8dd24bf785e2f0-supertux-editor-mockup.png SuperTux-Editor MookUp]
* Editor: show tile attributes in editor, especially for non-solid and unisolid there is often a very similar solid tile. Either add special editor-images for unisolid, some overlay icon for the tile selector <strike>or at least a hint in the status bar</strike>. (status bar done)
* General: Get rid of enemies stacking on top of each other
** <small>What does that mean? —[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:45, 9 March 2010 (UTC)</small>
** <small>I'm not sure if this issue still exists, but when one badguy falls on top of another and can't move left or right he will get stuck on top. - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 16:53, 19 March 2010 (UTC)</small>
* SuperTux should stand on the ground when a level starts, not fall down (move all spawnpoints to 1 tile above ground)
* paint tutorial board for backflip
* draw a bigger arrow for when Tux is jumping out of the screen
** [[https://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Image:Airarrow.png]]
* Create more music tracks for IcyIsland or add BlastOffTek's pack or the music by semaJD [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=875].
**semajd's music is added, we just need to add the music to levels
* [[Mr. IceBlock]]: transparency looks horrible on dark backgrounds, Wiki had a better looking version floating around
* [[Haywire]]: new bomb type (crazy pink bomb) that runs around after being touched
** Initial version is done. Waiting for feedback and improvements. See [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Enemies]] --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:08, 5 March 2010 (UTC)
* [[Mr. Bomb]]: Roll back to behavior of [[Milestone 1]], get rid of particle effects
** Particle effects are currently deactivated in {{SvnFile|src/object/explosion.cpp}}. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:08, 5 March 2010 (UTC)
* add PNG support for screenshots, BMP support currently broken
** <small>What's wrong with BMP support? It seems to work for me - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 06:11, 13 June 2008 (UTC)</small>
*** ACK, BMP-based screenshots work, at least with the SDL renderer. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 06:53, 5 March 2010 (UTC)
* at large resolutions frame rate starts to sucks, but CPU usage continues to stay very low, is that a artifact of GPU use or something wrong with our timing/frameskipping code?
** <small>Fixed?</small>
* bug: can't walk left and jump while pressing ctrl, when going right the same works, might be keyboard specific (Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 USB suffers from it, on the same PC a PS/2 keyboard works, maybe kernel driver bug), capslock is bound to ctrl and ctrl is bound as action key, using space for action works as workaround (Grumbel)
* peeking should stick instead of jumping back or jumping back should be limited to normal range that the camera can do
** <small>I think this is fixed or at least better now? - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 18:34, 30 April 2009 (UTC)</small>
* <strike>add an cmd option --default</strike> and/or a menu entry "Reset to Default" to reset any changes to resolution or aspect ratio (or something along those lines) (cmd done, WolfgangB)
* <strike>create an overview of the current levels</strike> — [[Milestone 2 Design Document/Levels]]
*: —[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:24, 11 January 2011 (UTC)
*# <strike>New unisolid snow tiles</strike>
*# Parallax backgrounds
*#: <small>That's heavily used in ''Above the Arctic Skies''. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:22, 11 January 2011 (UTC)</small>
*# <strike>Sector/Scripting use</strike>
*# <strike>Crystallo and IceBlock badguys</strike>
*# <strike>Add-ons + manager (To distribute these new levels, of course!)</strike>
*#: [[Incubator Island]] and [http://verplant.org/supertux octo's levels] should do most of this
*# <strike>Slopes and background tiles</strike>
*# Moving platforms <strike>(ice platforms haven't been used yet...)</strike>
*# <strike>Climbable ladders</strike>
*#: <small>Ladders are not in the Milestone&nbsp;2 document, but in Milestone&nbsp;3. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:22, 11 January 2011 (UTC)</small>
* try to fix white-lines around graphics problems (MatzeB)
** Where? -CT. da'Bomb
* butt jump animation (Grumbel)
* backflip animation (Grumbel)
* Crystallo dead/dying sprites
* Empty top/middle/bottom background image string should be handled as transparent image (more parallax backgrounds)
* write TexturePacker to place multiple images on a single texture (better use of texture space and fixes bug with tiles having junk on the edge)
** <small>Fixed with non_power_of_two? --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 20:43, 19 March 2010 (UTC)</small>
* Malformed UTF-8 sequences should not be handled as fatal error, just insert '?' instead (happens with German translation) (fixed? MatzeB)
* create some playable test levels for new stuff
** <small>Anything in particular? - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 20:07, 15 June 2008 (UTC)</small>
*:Try these, since they're probably most noticeable to Milestone1 users: --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 04:23, 7 September 2008 (UTC)
* remove border from menu screen or make it scalable for different resolutions
* remove pictures from credits, looks to uneven that way 
:<small>Really? I like the pictures. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 19:00, 29 April 2008 (UTC)</small>
:<small>I do too. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 00:05, 6 July 2008 (UTC)</small>

* <strike>there should be an script command to change the game speed (i.e. run in slowmotion)</strike>
* <strike>Tux isn't animated when he dies (caused by "grow-right" and then "gameover" being set over and over again, so framecount is always 0) - sik0fewl</strike>

* <strike>jump with keyboard up (done, WolfgangB)</strike>

* <strike>add a way to enable the console from within the game</strike>

* <strike>fix default peek keybindings, seem to be wrong</strike>
* <strike>Esc should pop the current menu (ie, back), not escape the entire menu - sik0fewl</strike>
* <strike>bomb can't be carried, but should be able to</strike> - sik0fewl
* <strike>make F10 toggle print-fps</strike> - sik0fewl
* <del>Spiky: Shouldn't alway sleep, either make it an option or better make a new enemy type for sleeping behaviour</del> (Thats already done that way, there is [[Spiky]] and [[Sleeping Spiky]]).
* <del>Spiky: Walkcycle animation looks broken, there is a frame missing</del>
* <del>Snowball(normal): Animation ruined</del>
* <del>Snowball(stay-on-platfrom): Replace with female snowball graphic</del>

* <del>new enemy type with more interesting walking pattern (follows Tux as long as Tux doesn't look, walks forward and backward, etc.), see Crystallo for a possible sprite</del>
* <strike>add 'recent files' to level editor</strike>
* <strike>can't run while carrying an object, but should be able to</strike>
:No, that is on purpose: Tux can't run when carrying heavy objects. So you can control where the player can not bring eg. the trampoline without a artificial "no stuff behind this line" object. Any reason why Tux should be able to run when lugging objects almost as big as himself? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 01:22, 25 May 2008 (UTC))  
:: With *large* objects I might agree, but an Iceblock or any other 32x32 one isn't a large object, it just robs the gameplay from being dynamic. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 17:13, 28 May 2008 (UTC)
::: The speed limiting code has been deactivated in {{Revision|6540}}. --[[User:Octo|octo]] 06:51, 5 March 2010 (UTC)
* <strike>General: Get rid of bouncing snowballs killing normal snowballs and other unintended behaviour</strike>
** Fixed in {{Revision|6554}} —[[User:Octo|octo]] 07:35, 9 March 2010 (UTC)
* <strike>[[Flying Snowball]]: Add acceleration/deceleration instead of linear up and down</strike>
*: Isn't this the current behavior ({{Revision|6402}})? —[[User:Octo|octo]] 18:22, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
* <strike>background graphics glitch at non-800x600 resolutions (black line where background tiles), reason for this is that background gets copied to a 1024x1024 texture with a black border, at non 800x600 resolutions the right edge becomes blended with this black border, need to add 1px border around the texture to fix this blending bug (alternative: use GL_NEAREST instead of GL_LINEAR)</strike>
