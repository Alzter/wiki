== Code Tasks ==
* separate lisp reader, tinygettext and other libraries properly out of SuperTux
*: <small>Is this necessary for milestone 2? - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 20:54, 15 June 2008 (UTC)</small>
*:: <small>Probably not. -- [[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 00:05, 6 July 2008 (UTC) </small>
* InfoBox crashes when Text doesn't start with a marker character
* write TexturePacker to place multiple images on a single texture (better use of texture space and fixes bug with tiles having junk on the edge)
* Malformed UTF-8 sequences should not be handled as fatal error, just insert '?' instead (happens with German translation) (fixed? MatzeB)
* properly GPL'ify the supertux-editor (COPYING file, GPL headers, etc.)

== Graphics / Sprites ==
* replace old bomb with new bomb sprite
** <small>Done? - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 03:29, 20 June 2008 (UTC)</small>
* add SuperTux idle animations (stage1: blinking with the eye, stage2: tipping with the food, stage3: scratching the head)
** <small>I've added the code for idle animations, we just need the graphics now. The blinking animation already exists, but it needs some tweaking - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 06:25, 16 June 2008 (UTC)</small>
* remove pictures from credits, looks to uneven that way 
:<sup>Really? I like the pictures. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 19:00, 29 April 2008 (UTC)</sup>
:<small>I do too. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 00:05, 6 July 2008 (UTC)</small>
* do a 32x32 top-down water animation for the worldmap
* Tux isn't centered properly to his collision box
* finish canon graphics, also snowball graphics, death, etc (Grumbel)
* create ice-spikes graphics (Grumbel)
* create ice-tiles graphics (Grumbel)
* create angry ice-block graphics (Grumbel)
* try to fix white-lines around graphics problems (MatzeB)
* repair jump Tux sprite (to dark black) (Grumbel)
* butt jump animation (Grumbel)
* backflip animation (Grumbel)
* snowman graphics (Grumbel)
* some decor for ice tiles, cracks and stuff (Grumbel)
* create proper background tiles for level22
* create mountain and night background
* finish icecrusher graphics
* deep snow tiles
* icicle graphics for decoration purpose
* animate minibomb
* paint tutorial boards for grabbing, backflip and run-jump
* draw a bigger arrow for when Tux is jumping out of the screen
* think of a new way to represent the exit area (snow molted with smooth ground below or so)
* background graphics glitch at non-800x600 resolutions (black line where background tiles), reason for this is that background gets copied to a 1024x1024 texture with a black border, at non 800x600 resolutions the right edge becomes blended with this black border, need to add 1px border around the texture to fix this blending bug (alternative: use GL_NEAREST instead of GL_LINEAR)
* add turn-around animation for smart-snowball
* when Tux dies he can fly behind blocks instead of in front of them, drawing order bug
* add sprite scaling

== Editor / Developer Conveniences ==
* optimize the build process, building SuperTux currently takes ages (I don't see how we could speed it up..., MatzeB)
* create some playable test levels for new stuff
** <small>Anything in particular? - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 20:07, 15 June 2008 (UTC)</small>
* reorganize the editor to something more like this [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/md5/68413a9004b402c38a8dd24bf785e2f0-supertux-editor-mockup.png SuperTux-Editor MookUp]
* Editor: sort (new) layers by z-value
* Editor: show tile attributes in editor, especially for non-solid and unisolid there is often a very similar solid tile. Either add special editor-images for unisolid, some overlay icon for the tile selector <strike>or at least a hint in the status bar</strike>.(status bar done)
* finish editor improvements (MatzeB)
* editor doesn't align canon and icecrusher properly (grid is wrong)
* fix editor so that it works without a mouse wheel (WolfgangB)
* add 'recent files' to level editor

== Meta / Organization ==
* create a timeline what shall be done and when
* discuss in the meeting what shall be done over the coming week
* create an overview of the current levels (Grumbel)
* document the behaviour of all badguys to be used in Milestone2 along with how they interact with each other
* fix and cleanup all the enemy names

== Menu System / Game Configuration ==
* <strike>add an cmd option --default</strike> and/or a menu entry "Reset to Default" to reset any changes to resolution or aspect ratio (or something along those lines) (cmd done, WolfgangB)
* fix/add/cleanup menu entry names and descriptions to be better understandable - '''[done, but should probably be reviewed before release]'''
* add gamma control to the option menu, see: int SDL_SetGamma (float redgamma, float greengamma, float bluegamma);
* make aspect ration option menu thing work
* peeking up/down keys seem to be unbound by default
* need to properly auto-detect and set aspect ratio on games first startup (i.e. on a 1280x1024 screen aspect must be set to 5:4, not 4:3)
* option menu entries are currently not in sync with gameconfig
* add scale-with-window option to magnification or something like that
* make left/right change an option in the menu, let enter apply it (needed for fullscreen)

== Levels / Scripting / Gameplay ==
* can't run while carrying an object, but should be able to 
:No, that is on purpose: Tux can't run when carrying heavy objects. So you can control where the player can not bring eg. the trampoline without a artificial "no stuff behind this line" object. Any reason why Tux should be able to run when lugging objects almost as big as himself? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 01:22, 25 May 2008 (UTC))  
:: With *large* objects I might agree, but an Iceblock or any other 32x32 one isn't a large object, it just robs the gameplay from being dynamic. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 17:13, 28 May 2008 (UTC)
* replace "you found a secret area" with a special sound (Wansti)
* SuperTux should stand on the ground when a level starts, not fall down
* level startup needs a fade-in, so does game startup, level abort and a few other places
* add all fade-in/out effects to DisplayEffect
* fix console command set_game_speed() so that it doesn't slow down the console
* peeking should stick instead of jumping back or jumping back should be limited to normal range that the camera can do
* bug: can't walk left and jump while pressing ctrl, when going right the same works, might be keyboard specific (Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 USB suffers from it, on the same PC a PS/2 keyboard works, maybe kernel driver bug), capslock is bound to ctrl and ctrl is bound as action key, using space for action works as workaround (Grumbel)
* camera vertical scroll doesn't work properly in a small window (i.e. it doesn't move at all)

== Other ==
* add PNG support for screenshots, BMP support currently broken
** <small>What's wrong with BMP support? It seems to work for me - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 06:11, 13 June 2008 (UTC)</small>
* create SuperTux .xo Activity for OLPC (Grumbel)
* at large resolutions frame rate starts to sucks, but CPU usage continues to stay very low, is that a artifact of GPU use or something wrong with our timing/frameskipping code?
* aspect ratio init code (Grumbel)
* think about peeking in relation to large screen size

== Enemies ==
* AngryBonusBlock: Have a bonus block type that comes to live when tux jumps against it and then chases Tux
:Break the "only good stuff from bonus blocks" and "same look same behaviour" rules? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 01:27, 25 May 2008 (UTC)
* create an enemy type that doesn't just walk straight into one direction, but does something different depending on Tux direction (ninja)
** <small>Is this a dupe of the Crystallo proposal for week 4? - [[User:Sik0fewl|sik0fewl]] 19:58, 15 May 2008 (UTC)</small>
* new enemy type with more interesting walking pattern (follows Tux as long as Tux doesn't look, walks forward and backward, etc.), see Crystallo for a possible sprite
* General: Get rid of bouncing snowballs killing normal snowballs and other unintended behaviour
* General: Get rid of enemies stacking on top of each other
* General: Have particle throwing starting enemies (fireflower like)
* General: Do something about the walking speed, feels wrong at the moment, maybe a bit slower
* Bomb: Roll back to behavior of Milestone1, get rid of particle effects
* Bomb(normal): let the fuse burn after one touched it
* Bomb(crazy): new bomb type (crazy pink bomb) that runs around after being touched
* Flying Snowball: Add acceleration/deceleration instead of linear up and down
* add some acceleration/deceleration to flying snowball
* Flying Snowball: smoke effect for the motor seem to be to seldomly triggered
* FlyingSnowball: Remove randomness, should be periodic and predictable
* Icecrusher: gravitation instead of linear, facial expression, maybe screen shaking
* Icecrusher(big): add a larger version of the icecrusher, twice the size
* merge AngryStone and Icecrusher, both do the same thing, just with different graphics (actually they don't, maybe they should?)
* Iceblock: transparency looks shit on dark backgrounds, Wiki had a better looking version floating around

== Finished ==
* <strike>change game back to use Milestone1 single-sprite SuperTux (done)</strike>
* <strike>switch supertux-editor over to CMake? (done, is now a simple Makefile)</strike>
* <strike>when BigTux ducks, the camera moves/jumps, but should stand still (fixed, MatzeB)</strike>
* <strike>there should be an script command to change the game speed (i.e. run in slowmotion)</strike>
* <strike>Tux isn't animated when he dies (caused by "grow-right" and then "gameover" being set over and over again, so framecount is always 0) - sik0fewl</strike>
* <strike>bring back single-sprite SuperTux (done)</strike>
* <strike>jump with keyboard up (done, WolfgangB)</strike>
* <strike>figure out a Jumpy replacement (Grumbel)</strike>
* <strike>rename trunk/supertux-sharp to trunk/supertux-editor to make it clear that it is the primary editor (MatzeB)</strike>
* <strike>Stay-on-platform snowball (done, WolfgangB)</strike>
* <strike>snowball-launcher (done. WolfgangB)</strike>
* <strike>integrate snowjumpy</strike>
* <strike>use pink snowball for stay on platform, use normal snowball for straight forward walk</strike>
* <strike>add a "scan for joysticks" to the "No Joysticks found" in "Setup Joystick" to allow hotplugging (done, WolfgangB)</strike>
* <strike>peeking should work in in both X and Y at the same time (for use with second analog stick on todays gamepads) (done, WolfgangB)</strike>
* <strike>add a way to enable the console from within the game</strike>
* <strike>the menu should shrink instead of just disappear - sik0fewl</strike>
* <strike>add a set_gamespeed() so that the game can run in slow motion for debugging '''[done]'''</strike>
* <strike>fix default peek keybindings, seem to be wrong</strike>
* <strike>Esc should pop the current menu (ie, back), not escape the entire menu - sik0fewl</strike>
* <strike>bomb can't be carried, but should be able to</strike> - sik0fewl
* <strike>make F10 toggle print-fps</strike> - sik0fewl
* <del>Spiky: Shouldn't alway sleep, either make it an option or better make a new enemy type for sleeping behaviour</del> (Thats already done that way, there is [[Spiky]] and [[Sleeping Spiky]]).
* <del>Spiky: Walkcycle animation looks broken, there is a frame missing</del>
* <del>Snowball(normal): Animation ruined</del>
* <del>Snowball(stay-on-platfrom): Replace with female snowball graphic</del>
* <del>Bomb: Replace graphic with new bomb graphic</del>
