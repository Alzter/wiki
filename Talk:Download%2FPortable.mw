'''SuperTux Portable''' aims to allow users to play SuperTux on mobile devices.

==User ideas==
*Actually, the screen sizes are either 128x160 for older colour phones, 176x220 for newer colour phones and 240x320 for some high spec phones.
*Programming Language: Java. (some mobile phones, like Nokias, do provide C. it should be avoided because it would not be portable or easily installable.)
*Some mobile phones, like Nokias, are equipped with Symbian, which is a very good OS and widely spread. It is portable and you can install easily apps/games. It uses C as programming language.
*As suggested [[User_ideas#SVG|here]], SVG artwork will allow rendering it at any resolution.

: Umm... It's just a tech demo.  I might work on this a bit if and when I get devkitadv working. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 03:42, 5 Oct 2006 (CEST)
