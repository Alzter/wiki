: Umm... It's just a tech demo.  I might work on this a bit if and when I get devkitadv working. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 03:42, 5 Oct 2006 (CEST)

No progress with the GBA / DS Version has been made.  Why??

I think SVG should only be used in 300mhz+ Processor devices, using it in a cellphone will drop a lot of fps.

== About the existing mobile phone "market" ==

Java is installed in some form on nearly every modern mobile phone. Writing it in Java supports the millions of devices that already exist and ones to come in the future. The hard part really isn't what language to use. Its how to support all the numerous screen resolutions these different devices have.

Can I get DS/GBA version source from somewhere? I would love to try it... :rolleyes:--[[User:88.192.122.234|88.192.122.234]] 11:00, 13 September 2008 (UTC)

Supertux is GPLed software. So if you have the binary you are entitled to get the source, too. --[[User:85.214.73.63|85.214.73.63]] 12:15, 13 September 2008 (UTC)

The source is on trunk at supertux-portable (http://supertux.lethargik.org/viewvc/viewvc.cgi/trunk/supertux-portable/). Grumbel has a [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/supertux-2005-10-13.gba .gba file], no idea what you can do with it. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 16:16, 14 September 2008 (UTC)
