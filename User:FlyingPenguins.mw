Hello, and welcome to my user page!

My favorite games are SuperTux and RollerCoaster Tycoon.

I am also a member of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikipedia] (my user name there is also FlyingPenguins).

== My goals ==
Here are my goals for this wiki. They may not be that necessary, but they would help.
*Create a sandbox page for beginners to make tests. '''''Done!'''''
*Make a spam blacklist page to block spam websites added by spambots and human additions from appearing on edits, or find a program that works on wikis that does that. '''''Problem sort of fixed by Marek...'''''
*Create a general talk page for discussions that don't fit in for any other page. '''''Maybe soon?'''''
