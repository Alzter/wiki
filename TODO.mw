Documents and ideas: [[Milestone 2]] esp. [[World 2]]

== Notes ==

{{Attention|s=Only developers should edit this page. Please add [[User ideas]] and [[Bugs]] to the end of their pages}}

'''High priority H:''' milestone goals that should be implemented for next milestone

'''Medium priority M:''' would be nice to have for next milestone, but should be secondary to high priority goals

'''Low priority L:''' things that should be fixed sometime

'''?:''' things that need to be discussed to determine whether or not they should be implemented

'''D:''' features that will be implemented but need further discussion on how to implement them

Apart from issues listed here, [[:Category:Needs Code]], [[:Category:Needs Sound]] and [[:Category:Needs Graphics]] list articles that describe content which still lacks one of the three.

== Programming ==

Moved to our [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs bug tracker].

== Graphics ==
* '''H:''' add more forest tiles; some of the current ones need fixing.
* '''H:''' Create a ghost forest tileset.
* '''H:''' image for castle door with 5 key holes
* '''H:''' new tiles for the forest worldmap
* '''L:''' graphics for ropes
* '''L:''' graphics for bubbles and soap (not necessary for Milestone 2)
* '''?/D:''' new enemies (first need to be designed)
* '''?:''' for most level backgrounds, create three tileable image parts that tile like this:
 +-+-+
 |1|1|
 +-+-+
 |1|1|
 +-+-+
 |2|2|
 +-+-+
 |3|3|
 +-+-+
 |3|3|
 +-+-+


== Editor ==
(The editor is not release critical therefore no ratings for these TODOS)
* Scroll TileList with middle mouse, Get different Tilegroups
*:Isn't that the way it is atm? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 18:23, 7 Aug 2006 (BST)
*::Only if one tilegroup is selected, with default group (empty string) you can't scroll, once you have set it to "All" or anything else oyu can. Should be bug (or feature) in GTK, it's not controlled by program.
* Create an overview widget (where to place this in the GUI?)
*: Overview for what? -- [[User:Penma|Penguinmaster]] 15:46, 4 Oct 2006 (CEST)
*::The sector. Like a minimap.
* Grab Mouse Pointer when scrolling so that we can scroll as much as we want (and the mouse is still where it was before scrolling)
*:I don't think that would be a good idea. I at least found that applications that does that are hard to use. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 10:46, 13 Nov 2006 (CET)
* More custom property editors:
** Texts
** Scripts (we had a very good gtksourceview based editor which is disabled at the moment, maybe split the editor to a separate dll and load different editors on demand?)
**:Why was it disabled? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:45, 13 Jul 2006 (BST)
**::Because it crash the editor on Windows, and because it add lots of extra deps. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:27, 20 Jul 2006 (BST)
**:::"lots of extra deps" anything that is not part of every serious distro? Why not fix the crash instead of removing features?
* Layer switching on keys 1,2,3,...,0 CTRL+1,2,3,...,0 to switch visibility, key 0 for objects
* Editor has strange behaviour when you select a tile in the middle, right-click select and move the mouse too much to the right
* Tool not working after loading new level
*:Added a workaround for this by reseting to the Select tool when loading new level. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 20:25, 8 Sep 2006 (BST)
* Windows builds seem to silently crash when loading huge levels
*:huge as in 100x100 or more like 10000x10000?
*::the level old world2/airkey.stl crashed both editor and the game itself on windows. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 17:56, 30 Jun 2006 (BST)
*:::the old airkey was 300x300. It makes the editor slow on my linux box but it's working--[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 00:14, 6 Jul 2006 (BST)
* Make the right click menu from sector tab a normal menu so that users can easily find it
*:Maybe add them to a toolbar? that could be useful. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:27, 20 Jul 2006 (BST)
* Add a new way to copy parts of one level to another.
