== Milestone 2 ==

Documents and ideas: [[Milestone 2]] esp. [[Forest|Forest world]]

== Notes ==
'''High priority H:''' milestone goals that should be implemented for next milestone

'''Medium priority M:''' would be nice to have for next milestone, but should be secondary to high priority goals

'''Low priority L:''' things that should be fixed sometime

'''?:''' things that need to be discussed to determine whether or not they should be implemented

'''D:''' features that will be implemented but need further discussion on how to implement them

== Programming ==

=== Collision detection rewrite (H) ===
* implement ability to carry Mr. Iceblock (and other objects) around
* smoke clouds are too fast
* rethink slopes collision feedback... tux becomes too slow when walking up and starts jumping when walking down
* think about an attachement mechanism for moving platforms
* implement paths for the moving platform, implement simple moving platforms
* fix bullet speed/behaviour
* check if unducking is actually possible or if something is in the way
* what to do when stuck under tiles (after using duck-sliding)
* '''?:''' do we want multi hit scores again?

=== Code Refactoring/Cleanup/Optimisation ===
* '''M''' (or '''H'''?)''':''' implement quadtree or grid to speedup collision detection
* '''M:''' harmonize to 1 single gameloop that switches between title, worldmap, ingame mode and eventually leveleditor mode
* '''M:''' use refcounting for GameObjects and implement a remove_listener function, so that you can keep track when GameObject get added/removed to the Sector. (refcounting is needed here, otherwise we'll get into trouble when 1 of the listener objects dies before it gets notificated). Unregistering in the destructor would be an alternative solution but an error prone one.
* '''L:''' change physics class y-velocity-coordinate to be like all other y-coordinates again (positive y to go down)
* '''L:''' name files according to the classes they contain, e.g. tile_manager.* to TileManager.* because it contains a class named TileManager and not tile_manager
* '''L:''' Refactor worldmap code to run like a normal GameSession with some special GameObjects

=== Actions ===
* '''H:''' Buttjump:
** re-enable buttjump
** should kill enemies with a certain range (''needs to be tweaked'')
*** eventually, enemies in a given radius should only be stunned
** animation (need images)
** should only be available when tux is big
** should break bricks if Tux is on top of bricks.
* '''H:''' Flapping:
** should be modeled after Yoshi's Island flapping
** '''?:''' check if this doesn't heavily affect gameplay
** animation (need images)
* '''H:''' Blowflyer:
** should be temporarily active for a single sector or time-limited (i.e. countdown)
** '''D:''' we don't know yet how Tux could gain that ability; probably some non-movable objects in the level (helium bottles were rejected, should be something more "abstract")

=== Scripting/Cutscenes ===
* '''H:''' add a global variable store for scripts or something like that holds information across levels/scripts and save/load cycles.
* '''H:''' implement a lighting effect for nolok
* '''H:''' create a script for the intro cutscene
* '''H:''' make it possible to modify the worldmap after the yeti has been defeated
* '''H:''' extract translatable string from the scripts
* '''H:''' make it possible to load additional script files
* '''H:''' always load some standard script file that contains helper functions like wait
* '''H:''' write a bit of documentation about the scripting API (at least a sentence or two about each function)
* '''M:''' create a script for the yeti outro

=== Badguys ===
* '''H:''' bring back stay on platform flag
* '''H:''' reimplement fish
* '''M:''' do something with the wingling
* '''H:''' badguy squish code isn't perfect at the moment... you sometimes get hit althought you should have squished the badguy.
* '''L:''' iceblock should slide over one-space holes
* '''?:''' do something with the tree?

=== Objects ===
* '''L:''' create a "sign" object, ie an object that can be placed on the level and contains messages (like the run sign we have at the moment but programmatically created so that we can translate it)
* '''M:''' add a simple rock object that can be carried around
* '''M:''' add a rope object on which tux is able to climb, also add a ? block that emits a rope when hit
* '''M:''' redo trampolines
* '''L:''' add a "geysir" object: It's a fountain of water that raises in certain intervals. It can be used as jump-pad as the water gives tux and up-boost when standing on it.
* '''?:''' Give tiles a configurable friction factor and make tux react to it. (for Icy tiles)

=== Optimisations ===
* H: Split more sprite decriptions into separate .sprite files so that they get lazily loaded.

=== Miscellaneous ===
* '''H:''' Documentation (README+INSTALL) is out of date. Someone with good english knowledge should rewrite it. Would also be a good idea to simplify the INSTALL docu a bit. Should be enough to state that we need SDL and where to get it. No need for advertising all the platforms SDL runs on and yada yada...
* '''H:''' Add more try/catch blocks in the source so that the game handles simple errors more smoothly. (This is very visible when loading config files or savegames failed)
* '''M:''' Make sure levels for version 0.1.2 still work. Currently this isn't the case because some files have been renamed and other small stuff... Our levelmaking fans will be happy if they don't loose the ability to play their old levels.
* '''M:''' when closing the SDL window, game bails out with <tt>Unexpected exception: Received window close</tt>. This is confusing to the users.
* '''L:''' when loading bonus world before ever completing a level there, game prints <tt>Problem loading game '/home/$USER/.supertux/save/bonus1-slot1.stsg': Parser problem: Couldn't open file '/home/$USER/.supertux/save/bonus1-slot1.stsg'.</tt>, again confusing to the user.
* '''M:''' save score on per-level basis to make high-score (this means coins/time)
* '''L:''' the camera does some nasty little jumps if you jumped up on a higher place where the camera didn't completely follow yet and you fall down directly again. This will suddenly raise the camera up.
* '''D:''' think about icebullet specifics
* '''M:''' Invicibility music should stop a little sooner than the invincibility itself, and make flashing of stars at the end more clear.

== Levels ==
* '''H:''' create 10 or more new levels of different size and complexity, using the new features of milestone 2.

== Graphics ==
* '''H:''' add more forest tiles; some of the current ones need fixing. Also create a ghost forest tileset.
* '''H:''' animations for the [[Yeti]]
* '''H:''' images for 5 keys in the forest world
* '''H:''' image for castle door with 5 key holes
* '''H:''' some kind of stone pedestral to place special items on
* '''H:''' new tiles for the forest worldmap
* '''H:''' image for marking reset points (maybe a bell that starts swinging once Tux touched it?)
* '''M:''' automatically make foreground tiles translucent if Tux stands behind them; create an option (in the level editor) to prevent certain tiles from being affected by that
* '''M:''' compensate players for requiring OpenGL with lighting and similar effects
* '''L:''' graphics for ropes
* '''L:''' graphics for bubbles and soap (not necessary for Milestone 2)
* '''?/D:''' new enemies (first need to be designed)

== Beyond Milestone2 ==

* more things than just levels on the worldmap (similar to SMB3)
