== Milestone 2 ==

Documents and ideas: [[Milestone 2]] esp. [[Forest|Forest world]]

== Notes ==
'''High priority H:''' milestone goals that should be implemented for next milestone

'''Medium priority M:''' would be nice to have for next milestone, but should be secondary to high priority goals

'''Low priority L:''' things that should be fixed sometime

'''?:''' things that need to be discussed to determine whether or not they should be implemented

'''D:''' features that will be implemented but need further discussion on how to implement them

== Programming ==

=== Collision detection rewrite (H) ===
* smoke clouds are too fast
* rethink slopes collision feedback... tux becomes too slow when walking up and starts jumping when walking down
* fix bullet speed/behaviour

=== Code Refactoring/Cleanup/Optimisation ===
* '''M''' (or '''H'''?)''':''' implement quadtree or grid to speedup collision detection
* '''M:''' use refcounting for GameObjects and implement a remove_listener function, so that you can keep track when GameObject get added/removed to the Sector. (refcounting is needed here, otherwise we'll get into trouble when 1 of the listener objects dies before it gets notificated). Unregistering in the destructor would be an alternative solution but an error prone one.
* '''L:''' harmonize to 1 single gameloop that switches between title, worldmap, ingame mode and eventually leveleditor mode
* '''L:''' change physics class y-velocity-coordinate to be like all other y-coordinates again (positive y to go down)
* '''L:''' name files according to the classes they contain, e.g. tile_manager.* to TileManager.* because it contains a class named TileManager and not tile_manager
* '''L:''' Refactor worldmap code to run like a normal GameSession with some special GameObjects

=== Actions ===
* '''H:''' Make smoke clouds slower again (they got messed up when changing time units to seconds)
* '''H:''' check if unducking is actually possible or if something is in the way
* '''H:''' what to do when stuck under tiles (after using duck-sliding)
* '''H:''' A player that is shortly invincible after shrinking/loosing fire doesn't jump of enemies anymore
* '''H:''' Buttjump:
** re-enable buttjump
** should kill enemies with a certain range (''needs to be tweaked'')
*** eventually, enemies in a given radius should only be stunned
** animation (need images)
** should only be available when tux is big
** should break bricks if Tux is on top of bricks.
* '''H:''' Flapping:
** should be modeled after Yoshi's Island flapping
** '''?:''' check if this doesn't heavily affect gameplay
** animation (need images)
* '''H:''' Blowflyer:
** should be temporarily active for a single sector or time-limited (i.e. countdown)
** '''D:''' we don't know yet how Tux could gain that ability; probably some non-movable objects in the level (helium bottles were rejected, should be something more "abstract")

=== Scripting/Cutscenes ===
* '''H:''' add a global variable store for scripts or something like that holds information across levels/scripts and save/load cycles.
* '''H:''' implement a lighting effect for nolok
* '''H:''' create a script for the intro cutscene
* '''H:''' make it possible to modify the worldmap after the yeti has been defeated
* '''H:''' extract translatable string from the scripts
* '''H:''' write a bit of documentation about the scripting API (at least a sentence or two about each function)
* '''M:''' create a script for the yeti outro

=== Badguys ===
* '''H:''' bring back stay on platform flag
* '''H:''' We go into kicked mode for a short time (you hear the kick sound) before MrIceBlock gets grabbed by the player
* '''H:''' reimplement fish
* '''M:''' do something with the wingling
* '''L:''' iceblock should slide over one-space holes
* '''?:''' do something with the tree?

=== Objects ===
* '''H:''' Check/Fix bullet speed/behaviour
* '''H:''' Don't simply duplicate code in the following objects: PoisonIvy, SnowSnail, Spidermite?, Hatch, SkullTile
* '''M:''' Make moving platforms move tux away/crush him when pressed against a wall
* '''H:''' Infobox: Don't show scroll arrows if the text is smaller than the box. Try pixelwise smooth scrolling instead of 1 line per keypress. Try to avoid scrolling textboxes anyway, players are bored if they have to read so much. Try to avoid infoboxes where possible, the game is played by lots of kids who either can't read yet or don't know english, they'll just be confused by text they can't understand.
* '''M:''' add a rope object on which tux is able to climb, also add a ? block that emits a rope when hit
* '''M:''' redo trampolines
* '''L:''' add a "geysir" object: It's a fountain of water that raises in certain intervals. It can be used as jump-pad as the water gives tux and up-boost when standing on it.
* '''?:''' Give tiles a configurable friction factor and make tux react to it. (for Icy tiles)

=== Optimisations ===
* '''H:''' Split more sprite decriptions into separate .sprite files so that they get lazily loaded.

=== Miscellaneous ===
* '''H:''' Add more try/catch blocks in the source so that the game handles simple errors more smoothly. (This is very visible when loading config files or savegames failed)
* '''M:''' Save game config after closing the options menu, not just at game exit
* '''M:''' Make sure levels for version 0.1.2 still work. Currently this isn't the case because some files have been renamed and other small stuff... Our levelmaking fans will be happy if they don't loose the ability to play their old levels.
** For the final release, we should also include a conversion algorithm that upgrades the levels to the new format.
* '''M:''' save score on per-level basis to make high-score (this means coins/time)
* '''M:''' Invicibility music should stop a little sooner than the invincibility itself, and make flashing of stars at the end more clear.
* '''L:''' the camera does some nasty little jumps if you jumped up on a higher place where the camera didn't completely follow yet and you fall down directly again. This will suddenly raise the camera up.
* '''L:''' Add an option to tilemaps to fade away if tux stands behind tiles. (This is usefull to hide secret ways and entrances)
* '''L:''' Add an ingame console, and a way that warnings and errors are shortly displayed ingame and fade away then. This is very usefull to make map designers realize their errors and for the game to display uncommon errors like missing write access for the savegame directory. (take a look at what the windstille console does for reference)
* '''D:''' think about icebullet specifics

== Levels ==
* '''H:''' create 10 or more new levels of different size and complexity, using the new features of milestone 2.

== Graphics ==
* '''H:''' add more forest tiles; some of the current ones need fixing. Also create a ghost forest tileset.
* '''H:''' animations for the [[Yeti]]
* '''H:''' image for castle door with 5 key holes
* '''H:''' new tiles for the forest worldmap
* '''M:''' up and down arrows for infoboxes to signify the possibility to scroll up/down
* '''L:''' graphics for ropes
* '''L:''' graphics for bubbles and soap (not necessary for Milestone 2)
* '''?/D:''' new enemies (first need to be designed)

== Beyond Milestone2 ==

* more things than just levels on the worldmap (similar to SMB3)
