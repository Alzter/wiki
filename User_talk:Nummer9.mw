: Hello and welcome to the SuperTux Wiki. Writing C++ code is not the only way of helping out with the development -- by far! Have a look at the [[SuperTux FAQ]] to get an impression of the many things the developers need help with.
:: Hi ! That sounds good. I can design levels and I have already made a great Forest-Level. Can I help Supertux by giving some levels ?--[[User:Nummer9|Nummer9]] 19:20, 20 May 2007 (UTC)
::: Although I don't speak on behalf of the entire team, probably. We also need someone who can make sounds for the game. Lots of sounds. PS: The user page isn't exactly the best place for this. Moved to user talk. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]]: N0 PH33R 12:07, 25 May 2007 (UTC)
:::: Oh yes, thanks. But I can't make sounds.
