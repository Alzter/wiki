Most members of the SuperTux team frequently hang out in the #supertux IRC channel on freenode network. 

If you don't know about Internet Relay Chat yet or don't know about freenode network, there are extensive articles on Wikipedia.

Or, you could just download an IRC client (e.g. XChat), connect to freenode and join channel #supertux.

Please keep basic netiquette in mind. Wait a few minutes after joining, then ask your question. If nobody answers, don't be upset - maybe nobody knows the answer. You might try one of the [[Mailing Lists]] then, as they are read by far more people.
