Tux can take the fireflower and gets a helmet. If you can't figure that out without a billboard you are too dumb to play Supertux. And then you'd never guess that now the action key has an effect. --[[Special:Contributions/78.142.140.194|78.142.140.194]] 23:22, 12 March 2010 (UTC)
:By all means: Please go ahead and create explanatory images for stuff you think should be explained. To get you started: The star (invincibility), grabbing objects and butt-jump and backflip should be explained in non-text form. You can fine the required files in the [[SVN]] repository under [http://supertux.lethargik.org/viewvc/viewvc.cgi/trunk/media/images/decal/explanations/ <code>trunk/media/images/decal/explanations/</code>]. I'm looking forward to your contributions :) Regards, â€”[[User:Octo|octo]] 23:59, 12 March 2010 (UTC)
