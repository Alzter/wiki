'''BuBuaBu :''' When a MrBomb is hurt by a kicked badguy, I think that he could be jump and then being ticking

'''litespeed:''' I like BuBuaBu's idea... anywho... I think that after being hit by a kicked badguy it would be a nice thing if mister bomb would start to slide (just as if being kicked, too) along ticking -- that's offer some new possibilities. :-)

'''yukaili :''' What would bump exactly mean?
