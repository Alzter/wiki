Hello all I am CT. da'Bomb. A Supertux fan who makes levels and graphics.



---'''Ideas for Supertux'''---

Owls carry more than one Sky-Dive.

Spawn points should have scripting ability.

(I would make these changes, but I don't know how.)



---'''Questions for Supertux'''---

What paint program was used to make most of the graphics? or was it actually painted and just scanned in?

How do you get the level converter to work? I have SCM installed.

Where is the code for the game located?(other than SVN) I want to add some code but don't know how.
