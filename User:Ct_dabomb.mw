---'''Ideas for Supertux'''---

Owls carry more than one Sky-Dive.

Spawn points should have scripting ability.

'''Supertux Forum'''
we now have a supertux forum. hosted by freegamer forums(but thats beside the point) http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=66
it is like a more permanent place for the community than the irc of mailing list, and cooler(because I am the moderator). Check it out and have fun.
