Hello all I am CT. da'Bomb. A Supertux fan who makes levels and graphics.



---'''Ideas for Supertux'''---

Owls carry more than one Sky-Dive.

Spawn points should have scripting ability.

(I would make these changes, but I don't know how.)



---'''Questions for Supertux'''---

What paint program was used to make most of the graphics? or was it actually painted and just scanned in?

How do you get the level converter to work? I have SCM installed.

Can someone tell me how to add/try new features I make to the game?
:These really aren't important questions, and you can answer the second two with a healthy dose of common sense and a decent search query.
::I know these questions aren't really important, they have been bugging me for awhile. I tried to get the converter to work, but couldn't figure out how.
