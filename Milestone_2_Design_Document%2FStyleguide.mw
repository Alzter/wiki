== Slopes ==

When creating slopes make sure that they are smooth and don't make sudden jumps in inclination.

== Tiles ==

Don't use tiles in the background that were build for the forground. Use only special background tiles in the background.

== Other ==

SuperTux is meant to be a fair and fun game, so don't create unfair places like a spike on the roof as well as one on the ground that require way to much precision and luck and just aren't fun to play

Other things to avoid:

* paths that are only two tiles high, make things high enough that SuperTux can jump
* don't create jumps that require pixel perfect precision unless it is for a special secret area
* don't use invisible tiles for normal gameplay
* keep the number of enemies that are on the screen at once small, it shouldn't be more then three for most cases
* do not overuse switches and doors, SuperTux isn't an adventure game, it is a jump'n run, so make the level straight forward and easy to understand
