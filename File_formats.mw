== Brackets, brackets, brackets (About the Language) ==
As you might have already noticed, the SuperTux definition files (just about for everything) are full of brackets ('(' and ')'). This might freak out a few BASIC or Python programmers who have pretty much developed a natural aversion against them.

"The Crazy File Format" used by SuperTux is [[S-expr]]. This syntax is mostly used by programming languages (such as Lisp or Scheme), but the devs simply thought why not to implement it as a data storage language. And so, the SuperTux data language was born.

=== Basic Syntax ===
So now you expect me to teach you S-expr. "You'd like that, wouldn't ya?" Okay, okay, let me teach you a bit.

Language syntax is (nearly) always best consumable when demonstrated on an example, like so:
<pre>(supertux-lisp-example
    ; This is a comment. It is initiated by a semi-colon. (Yes, you un-believer.)
    (some-integer 120)      ; Integer values are simple to input and to understand.
    (floaty-float 58.5)     ; Floating-point numbers should be self-explanatory too.
    (string-thong "omg")    ; Strings are simple and C-like.
    (intl-string (_ "wtf")) ; Internationalised strings are implemented not unlike in C with gettext.
    (boo-bool #t)           ; That's a "true"...
    (second-bool #f)        ; ... and that's a "false". (Well duh.)
    (integer-list 10 20 30) ; A list of integers, much like an array.
)  ; Don't forget the closing bracket!!!
</pre>
 <div id="aflknwerkamfs" style="overflow:auto;height:1px;"></div>
