The '''Incubator Island''' is a [[world]] of ''SuperTux'' where new, proposed levels are improved until they are ready to go into the main game. Levels that are supposed to go into the main game have to comply with our [[level style guide]].

New levels that are targeted for the main game, have to pass some basic tests first. Those “tests” include:
* Has a license for the level been specified and is it compatible with ''SuperTux'' own license?
* Has an author been specified?
* Is the game completable?
* Is every secret area and coin reachable?

If a level passes those tests, it may be added to the ''Incubator Island'' for general review. When it's ready, a level may be moved to the main game. If a level won't make it to the main game, for example because its main gameplay idea is not acceptable for the main game (the player must jump on invisible tiles to complete the level, for example), it may be moved to one of the ''bonus islands''.
