'''Incubator Island''' is a [[world]] of ''SuperTux'' where new/proposed levels are improved until they are ready to go into the main game or a bonus island. Levels in the main game have to comply with our [[level style guide]].

Levels have to pass some basic tests before going into Incubator Island:
* Has a license for the level been specified and is it compatible with ''SuperTux'''s license? (SuperTux is released under the GPL version 3 or later)
* Has an author been specified?
* Is the level completable?

If a level passes those tests, it may be added to the ''Incubator Island'' for general review. When it's ready, a level may be moved to the main game. If a level won't make it to the main game, such as if its main gameplay idea is not acceptable for the main game (ex.: the player must jump on invisible tiles to complete the level), it can be moved to one of the ''bonus islands''.

Of course, giving feedback is very important for levels that are under active development. You can give feedback by joining our [[IRC]] channel and stating your opinion, by sending a mail to the [[mailing list]], or by filing/commenting on an appropriate bug report in our [[bug tracker]].
