'''Incubator Island''' is a [[world]] of ''SuperTux'' where new&nbsp;/ proposed levels are improved until they are ready to go into the main game. [[Levels]] in the main game have to comply with our [[level style guide]]. Levels that are ''supposed'' to go onto one of the ''bonus islands'' do ''not'' go onto the ''Incubator Island'' â€“ they should go on a bonus island directly.

Levels have to pass some basic tests before going into ''Incubator Island'':
* Has a license for the level been specified and is it compatible with ''SuperTux'''s own license?<br /><small>(''SuperTux'' is released under the GPL version 3 or later)</small>
* Has an author been specified?
* Is the level completable?
* Is every secret area and coin reachable?

If a level passes those tests, it may be added to the ''Incubator Island'' for general review. When it's ready, a level may be moved to the main game. If a level won't make it to the main game, such as if its main gameplay idea is not acceptable for the main game (ex.: the player must jump on invisible tiles to complete the level), it can be moved to one of the ''bonus islands''.
