Most animated images you see in supertux are sprites. A sprite consists of a set of actions. An action is simply an animation composed from several images. The engine can render a sprite and change it's currently displayed action. 
Additionally you can define animation speed and an offset. The offset indicates where the "origin" of the sprite is. If the engine draws a sprite at position 50,50 then the "x-offset" will be added to the x coordinate and the "y-offset" will be added to the y-coordinate.

Sprites are defined in the data/images/sprites.strf file. You can add your own sprites there.

Let's look at the sprite "snowball": It contains 4 actions named "left", "right", "squished-left" and "squished-right". In the sprite description file this look like this:

  (sprite 
       (name "snowball")
       (action
         (name "left")
         (x-offset 2)
         (y-offset 4)
         (images "creatures/snowball/left-0.png"
                 "creatures/snowball/left-1.png"
                 "creatures/snowball/left-2.png"
                 "creatures/snowball/left-1.png"))
       (action
         (name "right")
         (x-offset 2)
         (y-offset 4)
         (mirror-action "left"))
       (action
         (name "squished-left")
         (x-offset 1)
         (y-offset -19)
         (images "creatures/snowball/squished-left.png"))
       (action
         (name "squished-right")
         (x-offset 1)
         (y-offset -19)
         (mirror-action "squished-left")))
