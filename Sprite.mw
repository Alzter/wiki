Most animated images you see in supertux are sprites. A sprite consists of a set of actions. An action is simply an animation composed from several images. The engine can render a sprite and change it's currently displayed action. 
Additionally you can define animation speed and an offset. The offset indicates where the "origin" of the sprite is. If the engine draws a sprite at position 50,50 then the "x-offset" will be added to the x coordinate and the "y-offset" will be added to the y-coordinate.

Sprites are defined in the data/images/sprites.strf file. You can add your own sprites there.
