Clicking on the [[special:preferences|my preferences]] link in the upper right while logged in allows you to change your preferences.

==Date format==
The following is normally rendered depending on preferences:

<pre>
 [[2001-01-05]] (or [[2001]]-[[01-05]]) (with leading zeros)
 [[2001]] [[January 5]] ([[2001]] [[January 05]])
 [[January 5]], [[2001]] ([[January 05]], [[2001]])
 [[5 January]] [[2001]] ([[05 January]] [[2001]])
 [[January 5]] ([[January 05]])
 [[5 January]] ([[05 January]])
</pre>

With your current preference setting on this project the seven are rendered as follows:

#[[2001-01-05]] ([[2001]]-[[01-05]])
#[[2001]] [[January 5]] ([[2001]] [[January 05]]}
#[[January 5]], [[2001]] ([[January 05]], [[2001]])
#[[5 January]] [[2001]] ([[05 January]] [[2001]])
#[[January 5]] ([[January 05]])
#[[5 January]] ([[05 January]])

The user-specified date format does not seem to work on the [[mw:]] wiki for links! It works in Recent Changes etc.
