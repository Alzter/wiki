__NOTOC__
Development is mainly coordinated via IRC and the mailing list. Be sure to visit both once in a while or you might miss critical stuff.

= Mailing List =

== Development mailing list (Supertux-devel) ==
[http://lists.lethargik.org/listinfo.cgi/supertux-devel-lethargik.org Subscription page],
[http://lists.lethargik.org/private.cgi/supertux-devel-lethargik.org/ Archives (must be subscribed)], [https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel/ Old Archives]

Except for the IRC Channel, this is where most of the development is being discussed. This is the place to send praises and constructive criticism, inform the team about publicity, etc. Note that bugs, including translation updates, should be reported in the [{{MediaWiki:Bugtracker-url}} bug tracker] and not to this list. Due to large amounts of spam, the list is currently set to subscribers-only, so please join before sending anything.

== Repository updates (Supertux-commit) ==
[http://lists.lethargik.org/listinfo.cgi/supertux-commit-lethargik.org Subscription page],
[http://lists.lethargik.org/private.cgi/supertux-commit-lethargik.org/ Archives (must be subscribed)],
[https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-commit/ Old Archives]

Anytime a developer commits their work, all the subscribers of this list receive an e-mail. Even though it is mainly beneficial for the comfort and teamwork of the developers, this mailing list is also open to people who are interested in what's actually going on with SuperTux.

'''Note''': You should not send any mails to this list, it is for commits '''only'''. Any comments about the commits should go to supertux-devel.

= IRC =

Most members of the SuperTux team frequently hang out in the #supertux IRC channel on freenode network.

If you don't know about Internet Relay Chat yet or don't know about freenode network, there are extensive articles on Wikipedia.

Or, you could just download an IRC client (e.g. XChat), connect to freenode and join channel #supertux.

Please keep basic netiquette in mind. Wait a few minutes after joining, then ask your question. If nobody answers, don't be upset - maybe nobody knows the answer. You might try the mailing list then, as it is read by far more people.
