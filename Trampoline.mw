{{Milestone 2}}
The trampoline is a small [[Objects|object]] that [[Tux]] can pick up and move around. When [[Tux]] jumps on the trampoline the springs compress and then Tux is launched into the air. Trampolines will allow Tux to bounce up to areas he could not normally jump to.

'''x''' and '''y''' are the coordinates as usual. '''portable''' is a optional flag which defaults to true.
Set it to false to prevent the player from carrying that trampoline around.
