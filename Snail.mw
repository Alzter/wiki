The Snow Snail should be an enhanced counterpart to Icy Island's Mr IceBlock. They currently share the same behaviour, i.e. Tux can jump on it to make it stop, carry it around and/or kick it to use it as a projectile. In addition to that, the Snow Snail could stop from time to time and excrete puddles of slime that cover the ground and disappear after a certain amount of time. Whenever Tux steps into such a puddle, his movement is slowed down and he cannot jump until he slowly worked his way out of the trap or the puddle disappears by itself.

The Snow Snail should move slower than Mr IceBlock and speed up whenever Tux is in its visible area, especially when  he's trapped in a slime puddle.

Since the Snail is used in the forest world, the name might be changed.
