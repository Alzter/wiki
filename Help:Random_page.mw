The '''random page''' feature allows users to view a wiki page at random. The default, and most convenient use is to show a random page in the main namespace, and is accessed through the [[Special:Random]] page. Users will be redirected to the selection.

[[Special:Randompage]] is an alias for the feature and works in the same manner.

== Namespace selection ==

Users can also opt to view a random page in a namespace of their choice. This is achieved by specifying a namespace as a parameter to the page, i.e. [[Special:Random/Help]] will select a random page in the Help namespace; [[Special:Random/Category]] will show the contents of a random category, etc.
