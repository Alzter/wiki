* After Starting supertux CPU usage is 100% and mouse and keyboard aren't working in SuperTux. OpenAL reports that it couldn't open /dev/snd. If you are using dmix with alsa add this to ~/.openalrc
 (define devices '(alsa))
 (define alsa-out-device "output")
 (define sampling-rate 44100)
 (define speaker-num 2)

After this SuperTux should work as normal. And you can now play all other games that uses OpenAl while you are listening to the music.
