[[Detailed Intro Storyboard]]

Tux and Penny are shown having a picnic at the antarctic shore. In the background, there's a pile of snow, which eventually starts shaking a bit, attracting the focus of the camera. Suddenly Nolok jumps out, and the screen goes black with a flash. After fading in, Tux lies on his back, Penny is gone. Tux finds the letter Nolok left and reads it. Tux looks up, and/or walks a bit to reveal Nolok's fortress in the distance. Fade out.
