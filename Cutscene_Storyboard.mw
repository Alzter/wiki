Note: This is mainly a collection of ideas and subject to change. Also, they need a lot more detail. Anything that has been agreed on by the developers should be transferred to the [[Milestone 2]] section.

= Game/Antarctica Intro =
[[Detailed Intro Storyboard]]

Tux and Penny are shown having a picnic at the antarctic shore. In the background, there's a pile of snow, which eventually starts shaking a bit, attracting the focus of the camera. Suddenly Nolok jumps out, and the screen goes black with a flash. After fading in, Tux lies on his back, Penny is gone. Tux finds the letter Nolok left and reads it. Tux looks up, and/or walks a bit to reveal Nolok's fortress in the distance. Fade out.

= Interlude: Antarctica Miniboss =
(Played before the level "No more Mr Ice Guy", if we include a miniboss there.)

= Interlude: Antarctica Boss =
(Played at the end of world1/level26)

Tux reaches a door at the end of the castle. He opens it and finds himself at a balcony outside the castle walls. An angry roar can be heard in the distance. He jumps down into the yeti battle area. After a short conversation between Tux and the Yeti, the battle starts.

[[Image:Interlude01.jpg]]

= Antarctica Outro/Forest Intro =
(Played after beating the Yeti)

Shows the transition from Icy Island to the Forest World. The scene also needs to explain how Tux got the flapping and butt-jump abilities. Some ideas:

*The Yeti could teach him the butt-jump, since he uses a similar move to shake the stalactites from the ceiling.
*Tux could learn the flapping on the way to the forest, because he needs it at some point to get there. A new character could be introduced who teaches Tux how to flap. That character will then play a more important role at a later point (possibly, but not necessarily in milestone 2).

A scene I cooked up:
(When Tux is speaking, you see his headshot, with his body offscreen to the bottom left; for the yeti, its headshot with body offscreen to bottom right. once the two are done battling, both have headshot with body off bottom of screen... dang i really need a picture for this.)

ANYWAY;

Before the battle: 

Tux: (going up to yeti) Hey! You! Did you see an ugly guy with the face of a cat pass this way, carrying a penguin?

Yeti: Who wants to know?

Tux: I do! 

Yeti: What's your name?

Tux: (Here the uer is offered a choice between "Tux!", "Slartibartfast.", and "Aaah, forget it.")

If the user chose "Tux!":

Yeti: Hey! You're who Nolok said to look out for. Now prepare to die!!! (attacks)

If the user chose "Slartibartfast.":

Yeti: Oh. Well, Nolok went that way —— WAIT A MINUTE! You look just like that penguin "Tux", in that photo Nolok showed me! Now get ready to die! (attacks)

If the user chose "Aaah, forget it.":

(Tux attempts to move forward. Yeti stomps and a spike falls from the ceiling to land right in front of Tux.)

Yeti: Not so fast! You look like that penguin... "Tux"! Nolok said to watch out for him! Which means... ... ... (roars and attacks)

(Big Battle here)

After the battle:

(Tux is, by this time, big Tux: if not, promote him automatically.)

Yeti: Ok! Ok! I surrender!!

Tux: Now: which way did Nolok go?

Yeti: That way. One question, first: WHY?????

Tux: He kidnapped Penny! My love! (is penny Tux's girlfriend? wife? what?)

Yeti: Oh. Whoooops... Sorry about the fighting you bit. If I'd known I wouldn't have. ..... Look. To make up for it, I'll teach you how to do that jump thing I was doing. (have yeti teach tux how to buttjump)

(The yeti's breath is becoming fainter now... he's dying.)

Yeti: One more thing... Nolok said something about using Penny for a certain purpose. But be sure to... to... to keep an (gives one last gasp and dies)


Tux: Keep a what? Ah well, better get going...

= Interlude: Ghost Forest =
(played before ghost forest section)
Tux walks up to the edge of the Ghost forest, when suddenly a ghost scares him, then the ghost vanishes. The scene then cuts to Nolok to says that Tux has done well to get so far through the forest, but will not get past the dangers in the Ghost forest(probably should have a name). The scene then continues to cut to Penny who shouts "Tux where are you?" it is possible this is where she then suddenly thinks up or starts to think up her escape plan.
[[Image:Ghostforest.png]]

Explains why there is a ghost forest.

= Interlude: Dark Forest Keep =
(Played before entering the first forest castle level)

Shows Tux using the five keys to enter the castle.

= Interlude: Forest Boss =
(Played before the boss battle of world 2)

Shows a conversation between Tux and the forest boss. Switch to another scene showing Penny in a prison cell, trying to escape. She is unaware that Tux is nearby. Explains why Penny is held in this castle.

= Forest Outro/Tropical Islands Intro =
(Played after beating the forest boss)

Tux is shown combatting the forest boss. Scene is switched to Penny, who finally managed to escape her cell. She flees through a window or a crack in the wall, gets out of the castle and disappears in the background. Switch back to Tux who beat the boss and finds her empty cell. Go back to Penny again and show her leaving the forest and entering the next world.
In World 3, the player will take Penny's role, and the story is continued from her point of view.

= Tropical Islands Puzzle =
(Played after a couple of levels and shows the user of some puzzle that needs to be completed)

= Tropical Islands Miniboss =
(shows Tux trying to find penny and nolok following tux)

= Tropical Islands Boss/World 4 intro =

= An Idea for the last two Cutscenes of the Game =

Nolok: WHY????

TUx: You kidnapped Penny and killed my father! ( how does tux know about father? explain in earlier cutscenes)

Nolok: You're wrong. I kidnapped Penny, but only to bring you here. And Tux…

Tux: What?

Nolok: Tux, I am your father. (assuming george lucas can stop spinning)

Tux: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 

Higherenemy:  (name this guy asap) Aha! Just what I needed. And with the soul energy from this penguin (he's talking about penny-- thinks tux+nolok can't hear him) I shall put my great work into action. And then I shall RULE THE UNIVERSE! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA—— huh? whasat?

Tux+ Nolok : WHY YOU-

Higherenemy: So! this is the last defense of the great universe?

TUx + Nolok:  Huh? What are you talking about?

Higherenemy: (Pointing at large device-- penny is in a glass cube on top of the device) This device is simple. It can dominate the minds of whoever I choose. I have tested it before (have this effect occasionally show up in earlier levels) but it needs a huge amount of energy to sustain it. I have discovered only one thing can provide enough energy: A mind. And now, with this device, I have only to start it and my dominion over the universe will be complete! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA! (all this time, penny has been trying to escape the cube—finally she manages it, runs off and hides.) Now then——where did she go? no matter. YOU can do just as well! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!

(Battle begins — Nolok helps Tux. higher enemy is invincible, but the machine isn't. Higherenemy keeps protecting the machine but it can be damaged if he is knocked out (higherenemy being knocked out only lasts for about 5 seconds), have it take too much damage and...)

If Tux loses, you see him stuffed into the cube, the power turned on, and a thick mist blots everything out to blackness, then you see "GAME OVER"

If Tux wins, the machine starts rumbling, Tux runs away, Nolok runs away, then:

Higherenemy: Huh, it isn't supposed to do that—

Tux: (to Nolok) Duck.


== BOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!! ==


The machine explodes. Higher enemy vanishes in a gigantic fireball. When it's over, Tux comes out, Nolok comes out, Penny comes out.

Penny: Oh Tux, you saved me!

Tux: Yeah. Um, Penny, did I ever introduce you to my father?

Penny: No... who is he?

Nolok: A-Hem.

Penny: What!!

Nolok: No, really. Out of curiosity, now that most of my palace is destroyed, do you think we could have a reunion at Tux's place? 

Tux: Welll... sure! Come on.

(Narrator : And they all walked off into the arctic sunset.)

(screen fades to black, appears "THE END")
