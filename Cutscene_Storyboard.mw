Note: This is mainly a collection of ideas and subject to change. Also, they need a lot more detail. Anything that has been agreed on by the developers should be transferred to the [[Milestone 2]] section.

= Game/Antarctica Intro =
Tux and Penny are shown having a picnic at the antarctic shore. In the background, there's a pile of snow, which eventually starts shaking a bit, attracting the focus of the camera. Suddenly Nolok jumps out, and the screen goes black with a flash. After fading in, Tux lies on his back, Penny is gone. Tux finds the letter Nolok left and reads it. Tux looks up, and/or walks a bit to reveal Nolok's fortress in the distance. Fade out.

= Interlude: Antarctica Miniboss =
(Played before the level "No more Mr Ice Guy", if we include a miniboss there.)

= Interlude: Antarctica Boss =
(Played at the end of world1/level26)

Tux reaches a door at the end of the castle. He opens it and finds himself at a balcony outside the castle walls. An angry roar can be heard in the distance. He jumps down into the yeti battle area. After a short conversation between Tux and the Yeti, the battle starts.

= Antarctica Outro/Forest Intro =
(Played after beating the Yeti)

Shows the transition from Icy Island to the Forest World. The scene also needs to explain how Tux got the flapping and butt-jump abilities. Some ideas:

*The Yeti could teach him the butt-jump, since he uses a similar move to shake the stalactites from the ceiling.
*Tux could learn the flapping on the way to the forest, because he needs it at some point to get there. A new character could be introduced who teaches Tux how to flap. That character will then play a more important role at a later point (possibly, but not necessarily in milestone 2).

= Interlude: Ghost Forest =
(Played before entering the first level in the transition area between light forest and ghost forest)

Explains why there is a ghost forest.

= Interlude: Dark Forest Keep =
(Played before entering the first forest castle level)

Shows Tux using the five keys to enter the castle.

= Interlude: Forest Boss =
(Played before the boss battle of world 2)

Shows a conversation between Tux and the forest boss. Switch to another scene showing Penny in a prison cell, trying to escape. She is unaware that Tux is nearby. Explains why Penny is held in this castle.

= Forest Outro/World 3 Intro =
(Played after beating the forest boss)

Tux is shown combatting the forest boss. Scene is switched to Penny, who finally managed to escape her cell. She flees through a window or a crack in the wall, gets out of the castle and disappears in the background. Switch back to Tux who beat the boss and finds her empty cell.
In World 3, the player will take Penny's role, and the story is continued from her point of view.
