The next developer's meeting will (probably) be held on a Saturday
starting at 15:00 UCT. Anybody interested in SuperTux is invited to
participate. The discussion will be held on IRC, network freenode,
channel #supertux. Minutes of the meeting will be made available.

Currently, there is no meeting planned.
