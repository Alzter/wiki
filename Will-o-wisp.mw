* Will-o-wisp is represented by a small, eerie light
* Its starting position will be over some kind of hazard
* When in range it will slowly start tracking the player
* Upon contact with the player it will engulf him, dissolve and teleport the player to its starting position (i.e. over the hazard)
* If the player manages to outmaneuver the Will-o-wisp for either a certain time or if it gets out of range, the Will-o-wisp will vanish
