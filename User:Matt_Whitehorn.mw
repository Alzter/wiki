Hello all, I'm Matt Whitehorn, I make the SuperTux mod "Super Burger World" and thought it was about time to make an account here. 
I am about to start work on updating Super Burger World for Milestone 2. I am hoping that what I do as part of SBW will help find bugs and help SuperTux overall. 

If you have any questions at all to do with Super Burger World or SuperTux related subjects, put them on the talk page, I will try to answer them.
