Hi all, I'm Matt Whitehorn, I make the Super Tux mod "Super Burger World" and thought it was about time to make an account here. 
I am about to start work on updating Super Burger World for Milestone 2. I am hoping that what I do as part of SBW will help find bugs and help Super Tux overall. 

If you have any questions at all to do with Super Burger World or Super Tux related subjects, put them on the talk page, I will try to answer them.
