== SuperTux Improved Editor ==

Why start a fork instead of contributing to the existing editor? More work to keep it in sync just to be leader of your own project or is there a reason to do it? --[[User:Allofthese|Allofthese]] 15:01, 6 November 2011 (UTC)

:The number of patches i uploaded to the bug tracker and never got applied into the main game taught me that i can't work that way. Forking was the quickest and simplest way to actually ''work'' on the editor instead of sending in patches and wait until they get applied. And usually they don't get applied at all. --[[User:Rgcjonas|Rgcjonas]] 16:04, 6 November 2011 (UTC)


Rgcjonas: since you we have moved to GIT and google code, you can make a clone of the project and easily upload your changes there and then it could easily be added to the real game. if you want I can do it for you. - ctdabomb
