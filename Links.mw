== Similar Games ==

This is a list of similar games found on the web. And the things they do better than supertux (so we can learn from them ;-)

=== [http://www.christian-schaefers.de Tux Strikes Back] ===

This is a level set for SuperTux 0.1.3 (Milestone 1). It comes with its own story, levels and world map. Features as quoted from the authors website:
* explore 18 levels plus a secret bonus level
* journey through many different locations
* discover shortcuts and a hidden bonus room
* fight Nolok's army in a challenging showdown

=== [http://allegator.sourceforge.net/ Alex the Allegator] ===

Jump and Run featuring Alex the Allegator... The game comes in a gameboy-style graphics (4 grey tones, 320x200 or so). Strong points for this game:
* It tells a story (some cutscenes with music, a bit of text). This really adds to the general atmosphere of the game.
* The allegator rolling is a unique special idea which brings some cool elements into the game
* You can play all levels again trying to capture all stars/cherries
* Nice dynamic music in the background (changing when you die, when the level starts, ...)
* 2 bosses, (1 boss after 5 normal levels) level bring new challenges

=== [http://smclone.sourceforge.net/ Secret Maryo Chronicles] ===

Feels, looks and plays exactly like Super Mario World. Let's hope for them they won't get at nintendos radar... Good things in this game:
* Accelerating and slowing down is slower than in supertux, making the levels more challenging (this is a good thing IMO)
* Some of the blending effects between the levels are nice
* Their levels are not based on a traditional tile grid, but you can place arbitrary (rectangular) objects in the levels

=== [http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/bobobot/ BoboBot] ===

A game same as in spirit to megaman. Although the engine seems limited in a first glance (no scrolling, saving, very small resolution...) the game makes lots of fun because it contains lots of cool ideas and diversitities. You see a new enemy, object or graphics every 2 or 3 screens which makes the game interesting.

=== [http://clonekeen.sourceforge.net/ CloneKeen] ===

A Clone of Commander Keen under the GPL.

=== [http://moleinvasion.tuxfamily.org/dokuwiki/doku.php MoleInvasion] ===

An open source jump and run game. Seems to be heavily inspired by supertux and pingus.
