This is a list of similar games found on the web. And the things they do better than supertux (so we can learn from them ;-)

=== [http://allegator.sourceforge.net/ Alex the Allegator] ===

Jump and Run featuring Alex the Allegator... The game comes in a gameboy-style graphics (4 grey tones, 320x200 or so). Strong points for this game:
* It tells a story (some cutscenes with music, a bit of text). This really adds to the general athmosphere of the game.
* The allegator rolling is a unique special idea which brings some cool elements into the game
* You can play all levels again trying to capture all stars/cherries
* Nice dynamic music in the background (changing when you die, when the level starts, ...)
* 2 bosses, (1 boss after 5 normal levels) level bring new chalenges

=== [http://smclone.arturh.com/index.php Maryo Chronicles] ===

Feels, looks and plays exactly like Super Mario World. Let's hope for them they won't get at nintendos radar... Good things in this game:
* Accelerating and slowing down is slower than in supertux, making the levels more chalenging (this is a good thing IMO)
* Some of the blending effects between the levels are nice
* Their levels are not based on a traditional tile grid, but you can place arbitrary (rectangular) objects in the levels
