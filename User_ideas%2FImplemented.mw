=== Pre/Post story movie ===

Instead of showing scrolling text, movies can be shown stating Penny's kidnap... and at-last the re-union. Wouldn't that be nice?
:I still remember the old SuperTux intro with Penny being kidnapped by the helicopter... as far as I know, cutscene support is on the TODO list, and I guess it will be used for the story intro. --[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 14:30, 7 Apr 2005 (BST)
:Wrong! The story was Tux and Penny were having a picnic, when a creature jumped from behind an ice bush, there was a flash and Tux fell asleep when he woke up there was a note from Nolok saying he had Penny and not to try and save her. So Tux looks sees Nolok's castle and sets off.
:I think in the story was: "A creature jumped from behind an ice bush, Tux..." ;-)- penma -
:: The *old* (as in 0.0.5) cutscene involved the helicopter. The new SVN cutscene is the picnic scene. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 22:00, 1 Oct 2006 (CEST)

Now we have the demos feature in SVN, and it shouldn't be too hard to make a 'movie' level for showing a demo mid-story. --[[User:Ajdlinux|Ajdlinux]] 23:20, 30 Sep 2005 (BST)

=== Add a gamepad configuration ===
It's currently possible to use a gamepad, but the setup must be done by manually editing the SuperTux configuration file.
:This has been improved in the development version. supertux now uses all available joysticks and allows to configure the actions for the different joystick buttons.

=== More starting points ===

Some levels are very hard in the middle and in the ending. Is there a way to make more starting points? So you haven't to start everytime at beginning of the level. Sometimes I need ten and more trials to cope a situation. It will be very useful. Thanks for the good game! Martin (pmw(at)web(dot)de)
:Reset points are also being planned. <nowiki>~~</nowiki>[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 17:28, 8 May 2005 (BST)

perhaps it should be possible to see that you are passing a resetpoint!
:Restart points exist in the SVN version, they are marked by butterfly.

:also in the virsion on the download page, "unstable", 0.1.9, or 0.3.0 (<-all the same)

=== New tiles for the worldmap ===
I already designed some additional worldmap objects for Supertux 0.1.2, e.g. paths through the forest or something like "water ways". Maybe in MS 2 some kind of swimming tux in worldmap could be possible, or walking over a bridge. (For my current solution I only added something to my antarctica.stwt.) - penma -

: In svn: bridges, boats

=== One-way platforms ===

<small>(An idea from Stephen2985, taken from lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel/2005-August/000570.html the Supertux-devel archives)</small>

I would recommend platforms that could be jumped through from the bottom but you can't fall through them if you are on top. SSB has this, as well as many mario and platforming game. This allows for Points of No Return, and would make the game capable of better and less redundant level design

: In svn: unisolid tiles
: also in "unstable" download

=== Better rewards ===

<small>(An idea from Stephen2985, taken from [lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel/2005-August/000570.html the Supertux-devel archives])</small>

A more fitting reward should be accomplished for collecting coins. Yoshi's Island had red coins, Super Mario Sunshine had Extra Shines, etc.
: In svn: 25 coins let Tux respawn from the latest firefly
: also in "unstable" download
* Maybe teleports (or something) that cost a certain number of coins to get through?
* How about the shops on Super Mario 3? they were really a good idea.. I don't understand why they dropped it for Super Mario World --[[User:80.174.65.16|80.174.65.16]] 21:16, 11 Aug 2006 (BST)
::Supertux might be inspired Super Mario. (Basicly because Mario did almost everything you can do in a sidescroller) But that does not mean we have to clone everything Mario ever did.
:::However, shops are not so typical in Super Mario games and appear in many other games, it is a coherent use for coins. There are a lot of things from Super Mario not strictly necessary for Super Tux that were mentioned here without complain ([[User ideas#Friendly NPCs.28non-player characters.29|Yoshi-like NPC]], the [[Nolok|BowserKoopa-clonic final boss]] and even the kidnapping storyline)

=== One-liners ===

*'''Pulling levers''' - activate/deactivate/open/close things. Added in SVN today thanks to me (mmiikkee12) :-) (they're called switches but they're more like levers)
*'''Standing on switches''' - activate/open things.
** In svn (not sure what revision) - just put a script trigger over the platform
*'''Wind''' - make it difficult for Tux to move, push him back, and push him much back if he jump.
** In svn (since r3640). --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 11:08, 30 Jun 2006 (BST)
*'''Ice pick''' - to crush blocking ice in order to enter closed areas.
** In svn (since 3468): Straw Blocks that can be destroyed with fire shot
*'''Falling bridge''' - when walk on it, it fall apart, so cant go back and must hurry.
** In svn (since 2296): Blocks that crumble when Tux steps on them
*'''Bounce pad''', thing or something that when Tux jump on it, he bounce up and jumps really high! :D
** SVN has [[Trampoline|trampolines]].
*'''Falling bounce pad'''- once bounced on falls down so you must use it well.
*'''Pushable crates''' - you push the crate to another place where you need it to jump on it so you can reach higher or something.
** SVN has carriable [[Rock|rocks]].
* '''Switches''' might also rise water level.
** Already in SVN (see level "Knee-deep in the depth")
*'''Helmet'''Tux could wear a helmet, stopping attacks from above, when he ducks he pulls it over himself, making him invincible
*'''Scrolling''' in menu so that we can access all the test collection directly from the game. Currently it just overflows outside the screen and can only be accessed blindly through keyboard.
** This is a must. I don't understand why isn't it still here..
:::You did not implement it. I don't think it is that urgent. Real worlds have a worldmap, to test something you can use command line or call level from editor anyway. --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 22:14, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
::::In SVN since revision 5420.
*'''BillBoss''' - there's probably a good reason, but why doesn't Microsoft play a greater role as an enemy of tux? Couldn't Nolok be Bill or one of his minions?
:'''Updated''': Perhaps nolok could ultimately be defeated by manoeuvring him into Redmond and getting "embraced, extended and extinguished" by Bill. :)
:: No. Similar reasons as in [[Rejected ideas#No Beastie]].
:: I personally have nothing against Bill Gates and Microsoft. In fact, I quite like Microsoft's products. --[[User:Gyroknight|Gyroknight]]
=== Greek fonts ===
You should add these greek letters to the game. How you can add Greek letters to the game? There are no greek letters in the game. They have a F33 so they are accessible. So they have a Ransom font that has to be accessible in DOSBox. Letters not changed: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), ~, `, etc. were having greatest. Letters changed: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7. A-Z, a-z. No-break space was filled in with JD. Capital R is vertical, 0, 2, 3, 5, 7 were made from different fonts. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, were captured from different fonts. Yeah, you don't speak albanian, but you speak korean. The letter you should be added will be: Ë. It's defined as U+00CB.--[[User:Sixtyfour|Sixtyfour]] 10:36, 16 January 2009 (UTC)
:What are you talking about? You sound like that guy who was spamming the fansite recently. And no, I don't speak Korean. --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 18:48, 16 January 2009 (UTC)
