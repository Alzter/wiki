So what's the difference between [[Moving platform]] and [[Walking Rock]]?

It might have additional features:
* invincible
* can be frozen
* hurts Tux and kills enemies on lateral contact and when falling on them (might kill Big Tux directly)
* carries Tux/enemies on its head
* falls down like Snowballs
* may float over lava
:I like the "float over lava" difference.  Platforms are made of wood and burn up.  Rocks don't. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 00:45, 15 Sep 2006 (BST)
