==Pre/Post story movie==

Instead of showing scrolling text, movies can be shown stating Penny's kidnap .. and at-last the re-union.  Wouldn't that be nice?

==Add a gamepad configuration==
It's currently possible to use a gamepad, but the setup must be done by manually editing the SuperTux configuration file.

==Choose Audio output==

:''In options menu let player choose a sound output like OSS, aRts and so on.''

It isn't a good idea for SuperTux to be playing with this. If you need to change sound drivers, use the SDL environments variables: http://sdldoc.csn.ul.ie/sdlenvvars.php.
