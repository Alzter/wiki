==Pre/Post story movie==

Instead of showing scrolling text, movies can be shown stating Penny's kidnap... and at-last the re-union.  Wouldn't that be nice?
:I still remember the old SuperTux intro with Penny being kidnapped by the helicopter... as far as I know, cutscene support is on the ToDo list, and I guess it will be used for the story intro. --[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 14:30, 7 Apr 2005 (BST)

:I think in the story was: "A creature jumped from behind an ice bush, Tux..." ;-)- penma -

==Add a gamepad configuration==
It's currently possible to use a gamepad, but the setup must be done by manually editing the SuperTux configuration file.
:This has been improved in the development version. supertux now uses all available joysticks and allows to configure the actions for the different joystick buttons.

==Choose Audio output==

In options menu let player choose a sound output like OSS, aRts and so on.

:It isn't a good idea for SuperTux to be playing with this. If you need to change sound drivers, use the SDL environments variables: http://sdldoc.csn.ul.ie/sdlenvvars.php.

==More starting points==

Some levels are very hard in the middle and in the ending. Is there a way to make more starting points? So you haven't to start everytime at beginnig of the level. Sometimes I need ten and more trials to cope a situation. It will be very usefull. Thanks for the good game! Martin (pmw(at)web(dot)de)
:Reset points are also being planned. <nowiki>~~</nowiki>[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 17:28, 8 May 2005 (BST)

==An extro - I imagine like this...==
I think an idea for later versions was if there was the possibility of doing some adventures with Penny, e.g. exploring some parts of the world. But it's not necessary - only a funny feature.
:We're thinking about telling parts of the story from Penny's point of view. --Wansti

==New tiles for the worldmap==
I already designed some additional worldmap objects for Supertux 0.1.2, e.g. paths through the forest or something like "water ways". Maybe im MS 2 some kind of swimming tux in worldmap could be possible, or walking over a bridge. (For my current solution I only added something to my antarctica.stwt.) - penma -

==Scuba Gear?==
Give Tux a scuba tank for the inflated+Flying mode? He flies until out of breath, then falls. Once on ground, he can take another puff. The physics wouldn't work in the real world, but it should be passable in a game, eh? When he gets hit, drop the tank off the bottom of the screen much like a MrSnowball hit with a fireball?

== Darker background ==

<small>(An idea from Stephen2985, taken from [https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel/2005-August/000570.html the Supertux-devel archives])</small>

Have the game engine display background as 75% brightness, making some levels easier to play, and making cave backround easier to see. Although this would cause conflicts with some other level designs, it would benefit gameplay in the future. The background (the 3rd level that doesn't affect gameplay) would be darker than the playable portion. (like in [http://www.gamespot.com/gba/action/yoshisislandsuperma3/screens.html?page=59 Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3]) At least make a tileset of a darker color reserved for this reason. Otherwise it might be hard to figure out what is background and what is an obstacle.

== One-way platforms ==

<small>(An idea from Stephen2985, taken from [https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel/2005-August/000570.html the Supertux-devel archives])</small>

I would recommend platforms that could be jumped through from the bottom but you can't fall through them if you are on top. SSB has this, as well as many mario and platforming game. This allows for Points of No Return, and would make the game capable of better and less redundant level design

== Better rewards ==

<small>(An idea from Stephen2985, taken from [https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel/2005-August/000570.html the Supertux-devel archives])</small>

A more fitting reward should be accomplished for collecting coins. Yoshi's Island had red coins, Super Mario Sunshine had Extra Shines, etc.
