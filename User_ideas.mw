==Pre/Post story movie==

Instead of showing scrolling text, movies can be shown stating Penny's kidnap... and at-last the re-union.  Wouldn't that be nice?
:I still remember the old SuperTux intro with Penny being kidnapped by the helicopter... as far as I know, cutscene support is on the ToDo list, and I guess it will be used for the story intro. --[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 14:30, 7 Apr 2005 (BST)

==Add a gamepad configuration==
It's currently possible to use a gamepad, but the setup must be done by manually editing the SuperTux configuration file.

==Choose Audio output==

:''In options menu let player choose a sound output like OSS, aRts and so on.''

It isn't a good idea for SuperTux to be playing with this. If you need to change sound drivers, use the SDL environments variables: http://sdldoc.csn.ul.ie/sdlenvvars.php.

==More starting points==

Some levels are very hard in the middle and in the ending. Is there a way to make more starting points? So you haven't to start everytime at beginnig of the level. Sometimes I need ten and more trials to cope a situation. It will be very usefull. Thanks for the good game! Martin (pmw(at)web(dot)de)
:Reset points are also being planned. <nowiki>~~</nowiki>[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 17:28, 8 May 2005 (BST)
