== Implemented ==

===Pre/Post story movie===

Instead of showing scrolling text, movies can be shown stating Penny's kidnap... and at-last the re-union.  Wouldn't that be nice?
:I still remember the old SuperTux intro with Penny being kidnapped by the helicopter... as far as I know, cutscene support is on the ToDo list, and I guess it will be used for the story intro. --[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 14:30, 7 Apr 2005 (BST)
:Wrong! The story was Tux and Penny were having a picnic, when a creature jumped from behind an ice bush, there was a flash and Tux fell asleep when he woke up there was a note from Nolok saying he had Penny and not to try and save her.So Tux looks sees Nolok's castle and sets off.
:I think in the story was: "A creature jumped from behind an ice bush, Tux..." ;-)- penma -
:: The *old* (as in 0.0.5) cutscene involved the helicopter.  The new SVN cutscene is the picnic scene. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 22:00, 1 Oct 2006 (CEST)

Now we have the demos feature in SVN, and it shouldn't be too hard to make a 'movie' level for showing a demo mid-story. --[[User:Ajdlinux|Ajdlinux]] 23:20, 30 Sep 2005 (BST)

===Add a gamepad configuration===
It's currently possible to use a gamepad, but the setup must be done by manually editing the SuperTux configuration file.
:This has been improved in the development version. supertux now uses all available joysticks and allows to configure the actions for the different joystick buttons.

===More starting points===

Some levels are very hard in the middle and in the ending. Is there a way to make more starting points? So you haven't to start everytime at beginnig of the level. Sometimes I need ten and more trials to cope a situation. It will be very usefull. Thanks for the good game! Martin (pmw(at)web(dot)de)
:Reset points are also being planned. <nowiki>~~</nowiki>[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 17:28, 8 May 2005 (BST)

perhaps it should be possible to see that you are passing a resetpoint!
:Restart points exist in the SVN version, they are marked by butterfly.

===New tiles for the worldmap===
I already designed some additional worldmap objects for Supertux 0.1.2, e.g. paths through the forest or something like "water ways". Maybe im MS 2 some kind of swimming tux in worldmap could be possible, or walking over a bridge. (For my current solution I only added something to my antarctica.stwt.) - penma -

: In svn: bridges, boats

=== One-way platforms ===

<small>(An idea from Stephen2985, taken from lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel/2005-August/000570.html the Supertux-devel archives)</small>

I would recommend platforms that could be jumped through from the bottom but you can't fall through them if you are on top. SSB has this, as well as many mario and platforming game. This allows for Points of No Return, and would make the game capable of better and less redundant level design

: In svn: unisolid tiles

=== Better rewards ===

<small>(An idea from Stephen2985, taken from [lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel/2005-August/000570.html the Supertux-devel archives])</small>

A more fitting reward should be accomplished for collecting coins. Yoshi's Island had red coins, Super Mario Sunshine had Extra Shines, etc.
: In svn: 25 coins let Tux respawn from the latest firefly
* Maybe teleports (or something) that cost a certain number of coins to get through?
* How about the shops on Super Mario 3? they were really a good idea.. I dont understand why they dropped it for Super Mario World --[[User:80.174.65.16|80.174.65.16]] 21:16, 11 Aug 2006 (BST)
::Supertux might be inspired Super Mario. (Basicly because Mario did almost everything you can do in a sidescroller) But that does not mean we have to clone everything Mario ever did.
:::However, shops are not so tipical in Super Mario games and appear in many other games, it is a coherent use for coins. There are a lot of things from Super Mario not strictly necesary for Super Tux that were mentioned here without complain ([[User_ideas#Friendly_NPCs.28non-player_characters.29|Yoshi-like NPC]], the [[Nolok|BowserKoopa-clonic final boss]] and even the kidnapping storyline)

=== One-liners ===

*'''Pulling levers''' - activate/deactivate/open/close things. Added in SVN today thanks to me (mmiikkee12) :-) (they're called switches but they're more like levers)
*'''Standing on switches''' - activate/open things.
** In svn (not sure what revision) - just put a script trigger over the platform
*'''Wind''' - make it difficult for Tux to move, push him back, and push him much back if he jump.
** In svn (since r3640). --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 11:08, 30 Jun 2006 (BST)
*'''Ice pick''' - to crush blocking ice in order to enter closed areas.
** In svn (since 3468): Straw Blocks that can be destroyed with fire shot
*'''Falling bridge''' - when walk on it, it fall apart, so cant go back and must hurry.
** In svn (since 2296): Blocks that crumble when Tux steps on them
*'''Bounce pad''', thing or something that when Tux jump on it, he bounce up and jumps really high! :D
** SVN has [[Trampoline|trampolines]].
*'''Falling bounce pad'''- once bounced on falls down so you must use it well.
*'''Pushable crates''' - you push the crate to another place where you need it to jump on it so you can reach higher or something.
** SVN has carriable [[Rock|rocks]].
* '''Switches''' might also rise water level.
** Already in SVN (see level "Kneep-deep in the depth")
*'''Helmet'''Tux could wear a helmet, stopping attacks from above, when he ducks he pulls it over himself, making him invincible

== Rejected ==

===Choose Audio output===

In options menu let player choose a sound output like OSS, aRts and so on.

:It isn't a good idea for SuperTux to be playing with this. If you need to change sound drivers, use the SDL environments variables: sdldoc.csn.ul.ie/sdlenvvars.php.

::The right place to change those settings would probally in a launcher application that starts before SuperTux itself and allows setting of sound driver, video resolution and other stuff, its a very common thing in Windows and might be a good idea under Linux as well, especially since those SDL environment variables are not exactly easy to find. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 07:47, 1 Aug 2006 (BST)

=== Nazi Gnome ===

* There should be in the game a Gnome dressed as a Nazi.
* The gnome should be fast, always jumping around , chase tux and not just be part of the scenario.
:Jawohl! Very gut idea. Make sure to add enough swastikas so ve can also get de "Banned in Germany" rating to boost de sales.
:Yep, I don't see how this could possibly fit into the game theme.
:Please no Hilter allusions. The badguys are not that bad. Same goes for Stalin, Bush or Mao. Don't even think about Saddam.
: I agree, bad idea.
:I agree,too no way!

== Unimplemented ==

===More Tux Moves===
Perhaps Tux could be able to pick up a powerup that would let him duck, then press jump and he spins in a ball, destroying enemies just like Sonic the Hedgehog.  Maybe a Glider that would let tux slowly glide in a line. I would love to see Super Tux become a Mario/Sonic fusion.  

===Alpha'd Tiles===
It would be far more realistic if there was at least an alpha'd water tile.  That way you can put the alpha'd water in the foreground and make the block of ice in the interactive layer look like it's actually floating in water!
--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 08:12, 1 Oct 2006 (CEST)
:As far as I know semi transparent water tiles already exist, even in 0.1.x. If you don't see them try to change to/from using OpenGL. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 10:00, 1 Oct 2006 (CEST)
:Posted as [[Bugs]]

===Central Storyline===
I believe the game really needs a storyline that makes the game not just about the arcade, but involves a greater plot. There should be a cutscene for just about every level and specific objectives (like you need to find a certain key or something before completing the level) Almost every level should have a cutscene that further adds to the plot. I also like the NPC idea because that can also drive the the plot. An idea for a storyline is detailing how Tux and Penny met and maybe add other characters that touch Tux's life (family, old flames, etc.)

===An extro - I imagine like this...===
I think an idea for later versions was if there was the possibility of doing some adventures with Penny, e.g. exploring some parts of the world. But it's not necessary - only a funny feature.
:We're thinking about telling parts of the story from Penny's point of view. --Wansti
::Penny is captured by Nolok and locked into cage in his castle so she cant move, so therefor you cant tell view story from her PoV because she cant do anything because shes imprisoned! -- smallfoot
:::Well, the first part of the story would be Penny escaping. The idea is that she would escape from the cage and you would play her escape. However, Tux wouldn't know about the escape and would continue on his adventures. You can take it to anywhere from there - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 04:18, 22 Mar 2006 (CET)

=== MS2 Preview ===

Milestone 2 is awaited for some time now. Why not set a deadline and release a preview version afterwards, no mattere how complete it is at that time? It hurts to see people wasting their time to create levels for MS1 which will never make it to MS2 becaues the MS1 editor does not use the new features.
: Been there, done that. [[Milestone 1.9]]...

===Scuba Gear?===
Give Tux a scuba tank for the inflated+Flying mode? He flies until out of breath, then falls. Once on ground, he can take another puff. The physics wouldn't work in the real world, but it should be passable in a game, eh? When he gets hit, drop the tank off the bottom of the screen much like a MrSnowball hit with a fireball?

=== Darker background ===

<small>(An idea from Stephen2985, taken from lists.berlios.de/pipermail/supertux-devel/2005-August/000570.html the Supertux-devel archives])</small>

Have the game engine display background as 75% brightness, making some levels easier to play, and making cave backround easier to see. Although this would cause conflicts with some other level designs, it would benefit gameplay in the future. The background (the 3rd level that doesn't affect gameplay) would be darker than the playable portion. (like in www.gamespot.com/gba/action/yoshisislandsuperma3/screens.html?page=59 Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3]) At least make a tileset of a darker color reserved for this reason. Otherwise it might be hard to figure out what is background and what is an obstacle.

*An even better idea - Make it adjustable. Make the player able to adjust the brightness of the background, or every tileset, of blocks and such. Transparency would be a great bonus too. Although one of the suggested changes for milestone two is making the foreground transparent where Tux is, I think this would take some potential level gameplay possibilities away. Transparency around Tux, if implemented, should probably be adjustable. Hopefully in a 'layer' section of preferences.
::The transparency and lightmap of a level is a part of level design and therefore really shouldn't be messed with by "normal" players.  Changing either of those things would potentially have drastic impact on the playability of a level, either making it easier or harder than originally intended, as well as possibly lose certain atmosphere aspects e.g. bright snowiness, deep dark forest, foreboding castle, etc.  [[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 03:41, 22 Aug 2006 (BST)
:::Eh... you may have misinterpreted me. I was referring to the possibility of adjustment of tileset color or brightness or opacity by level devs for each specific .stl, not by players. It's something that could make for some nifty levels, or at least more aesthetically appealing ones (depending on how it's used.)--[[User:Teal|teal]] 22:23, 22 Aug 2006 (BST)
::::Okay, s/player/level designer.  I think that both of these things have been implemented in SVN, but still needs tuning. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 22:43, 22 Aug 2006 (BST)

=== Background Tileset ===
<small>after reading grumbel's rant</small> a tileset for forest paralx background is missing. Standard forest tiles are too big.

=== Some more badguys ===

Here're three new suggestions for badguys in the forest world:

[[Image:Biella_mrlog_limpy.jpg|right]]

==== Biella ====
* Quick, flying creature, continuously following Tux.
* Could shoot stingers. 

==== Mr Log ====
(I designed Mr Log before I read about [[WalkingTotem]]. Looks like I'm not the first one who gave some thought to stackable logs...)

* Slow creature without any special abilities.
* Maybe "stackable", similar to the cactuses in SMW: Up to four "Mr Log" could be combined to serve as a high barrier, only destroyable from above (or with FireTux). 

==== Limpy ====
* Another slow creature, which is able to adhere to any surface. When reaching the end of a platform, it doesn't fall down, but continues to crawl downwards, upwards, or even underneath.


These badguys could fit in somewhere else.

==== Mr Missile ====
[[Image:MrMissile.png|right]]
Once he “sees” Tux, Mr Missile starts shadowing him. So if Tux stops he doesn’t stop until he reaches the place Tux stopped at. It is the same with other actions. Mr Missile is as fast as Tux. He is killed by invincibility and Supertux’s fire

==== Rolling Snowball ====
Rolling snowball looks like bouncing snowball except he rolls along the ground (obviously) when he “sees” Tux he gives a little signal and starts rolling as fast as skidding Mr Iceblock. Tux should be able to ride him. If he stands on him he “zooms”, taking Tux with him. He dies after 5 crashes on “zoom” mode or 1 if Tux is riding him. Invincibility and Supertux’s fire are the only other things that kill him.
:  There could be a rolling spiky that Tux could not ride.

====Mr Airtank====
*looks like a scuba tank with eyes and feet
*when Tux gets near he pufs out gas whitch harms Tux
*when killed, flashes (like Mr Bomb) and explodes (also like Mr Bomb)

====Super Snowball====
*looks like a giant Mr Snowball
*can get bonuses like becoming Firetux
*if Tux jumps on him he shrinks to Mr Snowball

This badguy could go anywhere.
====Mr Block====
*looks like shoes with eyes on top
*"gets" blocks somehow and uses them as a body 
*when killed only the eyes and feet die, leaving a block
:he could make blocks
:he could get them by pulling out of ground
:he could take them when he bumps into a wall

Here is a badguy which could fit into the dark-forest scheme:

==== The Evil Tree ====

[[Image:Evil_tree.png]]

At first, this looks and behaves like a normal background tree, so tux can walk "through" it.
(Especially mean when having the same tree often as normal background)
When tux passes a special point near the tree (surprise will be much more intense if this point is behind that tree), it becomes alive and hunts tux.

It maybe whould be a good idea to make the tree a little slow as it were strange to have it running around.
That could be compensated by making it a bit harder to kill.
(I also have the graphic in svg available where it should be easy editable and resizeable.)
--[[User:Henning|Henning]] 08:46, 27 Sep 2006 (BST)

==== Leopard Seals ====
Just another badguy. See wikipedia article about this: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_Seal
They can grab penguins under water, they can't breath and they die.

==== Badguys from User Penguin ====

=====Some Badguys for Icyisland=====

''Flattop/Flatbottom Iceberg''

Flattop Iceberg looks like an upside-down icy cone with eyes that follow Tux and lives only in water. When jumped on, speeds off at Mr.-Iceblock speed with Tux on top; at collision, Tux flies off and Iceberg crumbles.

Flatbottom Iceberg is a flipped Flattop Iceberg, so it can't be "ridden". Both kinds of Iceberg can be killed by fire shot and their points kill Tux.

=====Some Forest World Badguys=====

''WalkingStone''

It looks like an ordinary rock, but when Tux gets within range (5 spaces away), it grows eyes and legs and starts walking. When Tux jumps on it, its legs vanish and its eyes close. Tux can then pick it up. If Tux lets go, or jumps on it again, it speeds off like a Mr. Iceblock. This badguy can't be killed.

''Chameleon''

This badguy is 4 spaces long. It lies motionless, and when Tux is in its sightline (10 spaces long, 1 space high), it opens its eyes, waits one second, and shoots out its tongue. If it misses, it waits another second and shoots out its tongue again. When Tux is hit by the tongue, he gets pulled into the chameleon's now open mouth and gets crushed. If Tux jumps on it, it turns into a smaller, harmless chameleon which crawls around a bit and then disappears. If Tux shoots it, it shrinks; with the second shot, it dies. 

''' ''Water Badguys'' '''

''Swimming Fish''

The Swimming Fish is like a fish turned on its side. It swims just below the surface of water and dives at Tux like a Zeekling. It can be killed by jumping on it and by fire shot.

''Jellyfish''

The Jellyfish is hard to beat because it moves randomly in water. The trailing tentacles (2 spaces long) can kill Tux. It can be killed the same way as a Swimming Fish.

''' ''Underground Badguys'' '''

''Earthworm''

Earthworms slither vertically and horizontally. They are 1 space thick, and therefore would be best in 1- or 2-space-high tunnels. They push Tux back; or, in 2-space-high horizontal  tunnels, Tux can ride them. They only kill when they squash Tux against a wall, floor, or ceiling. They cannot be killed.

''Killer Earthworm''

Killer Earthworms move like a Limpy. They look like an Earthworm but are smaller with fangs in their mouth. They can be killed only by fire shot and invincibility.


''' ''Ghost Forest Badguys'' '''

''Mr. Lightning''

It looks like a small bolt of lightning with eyes and shoots down from a certain point, trying to hit Tux. It moves twice as fast as a diving Zeekling. It cannot be killed, and it hurts Tux when it hits him, after which it disappears.

''Mr. Bubble''

Mr. Bubble looks like a very fat ghost with legs and eyes. It mostly walks on the ground, but can also float up to 5 spaces above the ground at random times. Upon spotting Tux, it shoots bubbles at him, and Tux has to dodge them. If he doesn't, he gets caught in the bubble, the bubble shrinks to a tiny dot, there is a pop sound, and Tux dies.

''Mr.Bubble2''

Looks and acts the same as Mr.Bubble,but warps Tux.

=====Castle Badguys=====

''Walking DartTrap''

Looks like a walking SkullyHop, but shoots darts at preset intervals. Can be killed by squishing and fire shot.

''Suit of Armor''

As high as BigTux, it runs with its sword held in front of it. It can kill Tux, as well as any badguy that can be killed by Tux. When hit with fire shot, it melts and disappears.

=== More Objects to Meet ===

==== Radar Man ====
[[Image:RadarMan.png|right]]
Radar Man moves by disappearing from the square he is in and appearing in one next to it. He does not harm Tux he simply makes Tux have to move like him for a while. Radar Man cannot be harmed.
:Maybe its my poor english, but i dont understand what radar man is supposed to do.

==== Safe ====
[[Image:Safe.png|right]]
Something is hidden in a safe.  If it is touched by Tux then as soon as Tux stops touching it the thing is released. If it is a tile that’s hidden in it then to release it the safe turns into it, if it is a bad guy it appears on top of it.

: I at least do not like that idea. [[User:84.154.88.23|84.154.88.23]] 22:14, 25 Sep 2006 (BST)
: Every time you use Paint for anything other than pixmapping, God kills a graphics designer. I don't want to die because of you. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 23:15, 26 Oct 2006 (CEST)

==== Sleeping Snowball ====
Looks like a Mr Snowball with no feet and closed eyes, on contact with him Tux falls over and can't get up for a few seconds, allowing badguys to get him. Might be defeatable.

====Sitting Spiky====
* looks like a metal dome with spikes
* hurts Tux on contact
====Flying Spiky====
*looks like Sitting Spiky with propellor underneath
*if Tux touches prop. he gets blown away
*hovers in mid-air

====Robber====
Robber walks around and, on contact steals bonuses and runs off to somewhere. If he steals every kind of bonus, he gets a weapon, allowing him to hurt Tux.

:As an addition for this idea, it should be possible to pursuit and kill the robber to get the stuff back, though it should be pretty hard to get him. --[[User:Head|Head]] 23:12, 8 Dec 2006 (CET)
:great idea.
:Needs work... Besides, it sounds kinda cheesy. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 23:12, 20 Dec 2006 (CET)

====Scaredy Cat====

*runs away from Tux
*would be ''nearly'' as fast as Tux
*When he catches one Tux gets a reward-Special bonus?

====Badguys from Shylence====

=====Ghostly Tree====
Ghost forest version of MrTree. See [[Ghostly Tree]].

=====Walking Rock====
Unrelated with the "Walking rock" above. A big rock that works like a platform. See [[Walking Rock]].

--Shylence 03:42, 14 January 2007 (PST)

=== Some sounds ===
Could it be possible that there are sound effects when Tux walks on different types of ground, and when he hits the ground? e.g. on snow he makeds somewhat like "tsh, tsh tsh" and on grass (forest tiles) he is rustling? (You see, I have some problems translating written sounds from German to English :( )I hope you can imagine what I think.
:A sound if tux hits the ground should be possible. If someone creates a sound. For "walking" sounds its a bit more tricky since there are no tile attributes that tell the engine what kind of ground tux is on, do we really want that?

::Well, the tiles could get simple attributes, enabling this and, after some time of fooling around with it, lots of other effects. Deep snow makes you sink in and slower. Put the slickness of ice in there. Alternatively, just let the designer designate regions that have certain specs. [[User:84.154.88.23|84.154.88.23]] 22:17, 25 Sep 2006 (BST)

=== Friendly NPCs(non-player characters) ===
Perhaps there could be friendly(or at least non-hostile) beings in the world. I would prefer implementation in milestone 3 or longer so as to not put another thing for the developers to do. A yoshi equivelent(seal?) would be neat but may be an entirely different game altogether. Some other ideas: a character who gives tux a quest in exchange for a key, hint for a puzzle etc., a charater who fights with tux for a little while to achieve something against nolok, a character teaches tux certain abilities.          -F50

This would be good. Make a 'talking' system that scrolls on the bottom. Maybe some characters could give you extra supplies or even weapons. --[[User:Ajdlinux|Ajdlinux]] 23:23, 30 Sep 2005 (BST)

* Maybe modify the code for info boxes to let characters talk? Sounds good. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 18:27, 11 Jul 2006 (BST)
::Text is evil. The player has to be able to read and understand the language which is a requirement that was not there in MS1. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 14:21, 12 Jul 2006 (BST)

:::Stores or some such could just work with numbers and pictures. Having a _story_ told in little pictures would even add a very fun element.. [[User:RichiH|RichiH]] 22:42, 25 Sep 2006 (BST)

I think that the Yoshi equivalent, if used, could better be a Polar Bear in stead of a Seal. A Polar Bear can walk a lot faster on land than a Seal.[[User:Tuxenegger|Tuxenegger]] 17:35, 20 January 2006

: Bad idea, polar bears live in the arctic, penguins live in the antarctic.

what about more then one Yoshi equivalent depending on the world he is in like for ice a polar bear or a walrus and for forest a sloth or some kind of gecko (nothing looking like yoshi of course) and even if polar bears and penguins dont live together i highly doubt there is such things as walking snowballs/icecubes exist and the yeti is debatable [[User:Atomic1fire|Atomic1fire]] 02:05, 1 Jan 2007 (CET)

* I'll get to work on the graphics. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 18:27, 11 Jul 2006 (BST)

Perhaps Tux could ride a Gnu? -kcfelix
: [[Rejected ideas]] lists "no FOSS mascots". I also don't think SuperTux' target audience would understand just why SuperTux would feature a penguin riding a gnu. Let's leave Tux the only reference to anything geeky.
:: Perhaps we could make just this exception, since it is kind of a major character.  We could tell it like "Tux went to Grass(???) world and met Gnu, who joined Tux against Nolok because <personal reason>". --tuxdev

=== Bad guys and Immunity ===
I suggest that very few bad guys have complete immunity to [[FireTux]] or [[IceTux]]. For example, instead of no effect, have [[MrIceBlock|Mr. IceBlock]] get extra-ice stopping him in his tracks and making him take more jumps to kill in this state. Eventually (If Tux doesn't kill him first) the ice will melt and Mr. IceBlock will go back to normal. The same with the other bad guys. I think there should also be a downside for the bad guy in all cases.  -F50

===Stage Variety===
One thing that SuperTux is missing that Mario had would be stage variety. There are already above and underground stages, but where's the underwater action? Not to mention things like castle stages, stages with rising/falling water, vertically scrolling stages, those really annoying maze stages, autoscrolling stages, et cetera. Not to mention different locales, but I gather that those are already in the works. I refer specifically to some sort of forest. (And, might I add, picturing a penguin in a forest is pretty amusing.)
:they are going to use a forest in M2
<br>foudre: I dl the alpha for milestone 2, problem being is that in mario and other games they had more variety, ie: smaller worlds and more of them, rather then a long seris of same themed levels, the forest is sort of cool, but people need to work on more tile sets, i will try to create a mountain side/volcano one, but the thing about major sidescroolers they had several worlds, and some levels even had their own tileset, so i think there shouldn't be the same fear of extra tile sets here either, i mean keeping it reasonable of course. and of course more enemies, the new set of forest creatures was sort of cool, still needs more varity

See: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_and_video_game_settings

=== Female Players ===

For the female players: You can play Penny and will have to rescue Tux.
:No that would be unrealistic. Everybody know that Tux is a strong superhero and that Nolok or anyone could never ever kidnap him and that even if they managed to, then Penny could do nothing besides crying and going him and eating until she get fat or suicide!
::Yeah, right... As you can read in several other places on the wiki, Penny will be a playable character in Milestone 3.

=== Level Start ===

Enter level with jump button.
:There's a problem I experienced with this : when you choose Up arrow key as the jump button, you can't move up anymore on the worldmap, since there are two actions for one key. Maybe worldmap movement keys should be customizable or something? ----

:: Why would they not use the same keys for movement as in the levels? Some of us vi and nethack types might like to use hjkl instead.. [[User:RichiH|RichiH]] 22:45, 25 Sep 2006 (BST)

=== Hidden Blocks ===
* Hidden blocks containing items (power-ups, extra lives, etc) as well as ordinary blocks for stepping stones should exist.
: Ordinary blocks are omplemented as [[User_Manual#Secret_Blocks|Secret Blocks]]. Hidden bonus blocks are up for discussion. --[[User:84.146.234.2|84.146.234.2]] 06:21, 18 Sep 2006 (BST)
* Tux should fall through hidden blocks before they're hit.  Another implementation for clouds and elevated platforms should be used.  The blocks would be more 'hidden' if you can only find them by hitting them from below.
: Implemented as [[User_Manual#Secret_Blocks|Secret Blocks]] --[[User:84.146.234.2|84.146.234.2]] 06:21, 18 Sep 2006 (BST)
**Cloud platforms should be able to be jumped onto from below, similarly to how jumping onto platforms in Mario games works.
: Implemented as Unisolid [[Tiles]] --[[User:84.146.234.2|84.146.234.2]] 06:21, 18 Sep 2006 (BST)
* Tux should be able to horizontally and/or diagonally jump through hidden blocks (transparently) before the blocks have been hit from below, as opposed to getting the jumping-against-a-wall effect.  The current implementation causes Tux fatalities in some levels.
: Already implemented in aforementioned [[User_Manual#Secret_Blocks|Secret Blocks]] --[[User:84.146.234.2|84.146.234.2]] 06:21, 18 Sep 2006 (BST)

=== Collecting Stuff ===

I think what makes some games really enjoyable is the possibility of collecting things. One (maybe totally crazy) idea: if Tux could spit bubbles, he probably could catch enemies and carry them to a specific place, like a museum, which is located on the world map. For completing the collection with all badguys of the current world, Tux would get a reward.

=== Cheats ===

Tux wears a little party hat when you type "tux rocks".
When you type "iddqd", tux shakes his head.
When you type the name of a specific badguy, Tux looks like that badguy.

=== SVG ===
Maybe it would be a good idea to use SVG artwork. We can render it at any resolution, so we don't have to be tied at 800*600. [[User:Cristan|Cristan]]

=== 1.0 ===
I've played an old version of the SVN build, and milestone 2 really looks like a very complete game to me. It features everything what I'd expect in SuperTux. I've had just 1 crash on exiting the program, but I really think that will be fixed when going final. Why not call milestone 2 "SuperTux 1.0"? Most people think when they see "0.2" that it is some crappy beta version, which milestone 2 obviously is not. [[User:Cristan|Cristan]] 00:38, 26 Oct 2006 (CEST)

===One-Liners===
smallfoot made a page, see [[Smallfoot's ideas]].
:Are they so bad that they need a seperate page?

==== Worlds, scenarios, levels ====
*A Glitch world one put somewhere hard to find [[User:Atomic1fire|Atomic1fire]] 02:35, 1 Jan 2007 (CET)
*Water world
*Cave
*Lava world
*Forrest
*Ice world
*Jungle
*Desert
*Space
*Sky/cloud world?
*Dark level where is night!
*Levels where Tux has to go up rather than forward -- He could be climbing a mountain or a really tall tree.
*Geeky computer/circuit board world - "Tux decided that the only way to get Penny back would be to hack into Nolok's computer..." well, worth a try.
:No. Not another so called "geek game". Kill evil Bill G. won't work with the existin storyline. --[[User:62.214.246.213|62.214.246.213]] 21:26, 23 Jul 2006 (BST)
:Someone suggested this on the mailing list, and Marek came up with a concept: An easter egg that makes Nolok look like Bill or Steve (Ballmer, not Jobs). I figure it's at least worth a try, but a comlete storyline revision would be imprudent in keeping with this game's general philosophy to be a Mario homage, only. If you want to flag Gates, go play XTux.--[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 03:08, 28 Jul 2006 (BST)
:Tux could hack Nolok's computer to find out where Nolok will take Penny next? 
why not a portal type place where he gets sucked in or a ray gun firing a beam at tux digitizing him or something [[User:Atomic1fire|Atomic1fire]] 02:35, 1 Jan 2007 (CET)
:Because they did that in "Tron" already.

==== Other ====
*'''Diving''' - in water?
*'''Flying''' - in air?
*Hang glider to fly!
*'''Low gravity''' - extra high jumps, slow fall down
:you can do that already
*'''Walk on water''' - but only if the water isn't deep
*'''Slippery surfaces''' - like a slippery ice where can glide and difficult control Tux.
*'''Pushable/rollable stone''' - you roll it over enemies so they die, and can roll it to place so you jump up on it to reach higher.
*'''Moving script triggers''' - for example, have a cloud of smoke flying around and if it touches Tux it puts him to sleep for a few seconds.
* '''[[Swimming |Swim]]''' in water like <del>Mario</del> a penguin.
** Grubmel's grumbling about this already, and it seems justified. See "Grumbel's Grumbles".
** Update: partially implemented in SVN (at latest, rv. 4102). Tux can float, but not swim.
:Oh well. Looks like nobody cared about the "'''Before''' implementing swimming there are some details that need to be specified" on the [[Swimming]] page. :-(
::Wrong. The SVN version just had some of the hooks added that will be needed to implement swimming, regardless of the final look and feel. Just for demonstration purposes these hooks are now used to make Tux float.
* '''Lava tiles''' might be solid, making possible for some enemies (and maybe Invincible Tux) to walk on them. They may also kill even BigTux on touch instead of simply hurting him.
* '''Special blocks''' solid for enemies but not for Tux, and maybe vice-versa.
* '''Truly floating platforms''', that actually float on water: if one of these is placed in midair, it will fall down, stopping when hitting solid or water tiles; if the level of water rises/falls, they will automatically rise/fall (SVN currently allows only platforms with a fixed path).
* '''Grouping objects in the editor''', or at least being able to select more than one at a time - this would make it much easier to do levels with many similar objects. Say I have 20 snowballs, and I decide I need only 5 there. It takes 30 clicks to delete 15 snowballs - I should be able to select 15 of them, right click one and delete them all.
* '''Scrolling''': I know we have worldmaps for most level sets, but the test collection could use a scrolling feature. There are many more levels than the screen shows.
* '''More forest world badguys''': It'd be cool to have falling things like the stalactites (monkeys that jump on Tux?) and bouncing things (tumbleweeds?) that fit in with Forest world levels.

==== 2-player mode ====
*How about 2 player support.Maybe the FreeBSD demon (freebsd.org) or another penguin for player 2.
: There's already a project that tries to add a [[Multiplayer mode]].

====Art====
Bubble - float and pop in air

==== Code ====
* This comment (src/player.cpp:493) kind of confused me:
<code>  // TODO: we don't have an animation for firetux backflipping, so let's revert to bigtux </code>
** There *is* a graphic for that. Also, it's been closed as "intended behavior" on the [[Bugs]] page that firetux loses his hat when backflipping, I don't think it should be. (Losing powerups for no good reason is annoying)

==== 3D Tux ====
I think that Supertux would be even cooler in 3D. It could be partially implemented, for example, there could be substages in 3d, or a 3d world later on? Or maybe it would more apropriate in a future spin off game?
: Are you thinking of tuxaqfh.sourceforge.net, or something more like the 2.5D New Super Mario which uses 3D sprites in a 2D world. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 22:51, 3 Oct 2006 (CEST)
:: Like XTux? I don't think 2.5D would work with a completely 2D sidescroller like SuperTux. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 02:19, 10 Oct 2006 (CEST)
:::No, he means like New Super Mario Bros or Super Smash Bros Melee, where the game is 2d side-scrolling but the graphics are 3D. (I mean tuxdev meant that, not the OP) [[User:67.168.194.207|67.168.194.207]] 02:12, 11 Oct 2006 (CEST)
: 2.5D approach is cool, maybe the game could be played mostly in 2.5D , and the bosses in 3D like tuxaqfh.sourceforge.net.  Just throwing aruond ideas.--[[User:66.153.31.148|66.153.31.148]] 06:54, 4 Oct 2006 (CEST)
: Maybe leave the game itself how it is, and have 3D cutscenes?
:: It's a good idea. Leave the game how it is, only change the cutscenes. [[User:DirtY iCE|DirtY iCE]] 10:54, 5 Nov 2006 (CET)
:This idea may seem a bit wacky, but tux could fall into a hidden hole where he gets virtualized and has to fight virtual enemies in a virtual 3D landscape for a few levels then he has to go through a portal in the last 3D level to take him back to 2D. The only problem is the huge amount of code and graphics that would be required, thus resulting in a huge package size. Perhaps this could be an addon for a new bonus world?

====Pirates====
Any bad guy pirate with a sword also be fun to the milestone 2. 
<br>foudre: yer idea be seconded
[[Category:Design]]

==== Collect coins by shooting ====
It should be possible to collect coins by shooting at them with the fire flower powerup. AFAIR, you can do this in Super Mario games. --[[User:217.235.171.77|217.235.171.77]] 01:24, 9 Dec 2006 (CET)
* No, but maybe get coins for killing badguys?
