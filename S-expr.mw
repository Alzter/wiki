== Introduction ==
SuperTux uses S-Expressions for the majority of its files. Its a datatype mostly known from the Lisp programming language. A Lisp expression is simply a list that contains stuff: integers (= numbers without decimal part), float/real numbers (= numbers with decimal part), symbols, strings, booleans and, most importantly, other lists.

The possibility to nest lists makes the format very flexible and a good choice as a general purpose file format for SuperTux. The list elements are encoded as following:

* '''Integer''': simply the number
** Examples: <tt>8</tt>, <tt>42</tt> or <tt>12442</tt>
* '''Float''': simply the number with a dot as the decimal separator
** Examples: <tt>8.5</tt>, <tt>23.0</tt> or <tt>0.002</tt>
* '''String''' (sequences of characters) should be enclosed in quotation marks.
** Examples: <tt>"string"</tt>, <tt>"Hello World"</tt>, <tt>"One day after Tux had dreamed about Penny, ..."</tt>.
** Escaping: backslashes (<tt>\</tt>) are handled like C escape sequences and allow to embed quotation marks into a string by writing <tt>\"</tt>. This is useful for scripts but also has an obvious downside: backslashes themselves must be escaped (<tt>\\</tt>).
* '''Boolean''': A boolean is a logical value that has either the value true or false. <tt>#t</tt> stands for true and <tt>#f</tt> for false in a Lisp file.
* '''Symbol''': Simply add the symbol. Symbols look like unquoted strings and give the lists their intended meaning. Examples for symbols are <tt>symbol</tt>, <tt>sprite</tt>, <tt>another-symbol</tt>. They tend to appear at the beginning of lists.
* '''List''': You can nest lists in a Lisp file by enclosing the list in brackets. Example of a list with 2 symbols in it: <tt>(a list)</tt>. A list with a string and three integer numbers: <tt>("test" 1 2 3)</tt>. A list containing two empty lists: <tt>( () () )</tt>.

Whitespace (spaces, new lines and tabs) are ignored (unless they're inside a string, of course).

Comments are initiated with a semicolon (<tt>;</tt>). They comment out anything that follows until the end of the line.

== Examples ==
Some examples of real files used in SuperTux follow. (Ellipsis (three dots) indicate that we left out some parts of the file.)
