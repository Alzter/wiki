= Introduction = 
Supertux uses S-Expressions for most of it's files. Its a datatype mostly known from the lisp programming language. A lisp expression is simply a list that contains stuff: integer numbers (= numbers without fraction part), float/real numbers (= numbers with fraction part), symbols, strings, booleans and most important other lists.
The possibility to add other lists to list makes the format very flexible and a good choice as a general purpose file format for supertux. The list elements are encoded as following:

* ''Integer'': simply the number like 8, 42 or 12442
* ''Float'': simple add the number like 8.5, 23.0, 0.002
* ''Strings'': A sequence of characters is called a string and should be enclosed in quotation marks. Examples:
 "string", "Hello World", "One day after tux had dreamed about penny...". \ chars are handled special in strings, they'll be interpreted like C escape sequences and allow to embedd " chars into the string by writing \". This is usefull for scripts.
* ''Booleans'': A boolean is a logical value that has either the value true or false. You write #t for true and #f for fales into a lisp file.
* ''Symbols'': Simple add the symbol. Symbols have special meaning to the parser and give the lists a meaning. You should only add symbols where they make sense in the fileformat. Examples for symbols are symbol, sprite, another-symbol
* You can write other lists into a lisp file by enclosing the list in brackets. Example of a list with 2 symbols in it: (a list). A list with a string and 3 integer numbers: ("test" 1 2 3) a list with 2 empty lists inside ( () () ).
* Spaces inside a lisp file are ignored (unless they're inside a string of course)
