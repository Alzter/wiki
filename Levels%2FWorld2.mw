There are many levels in svn's World 2 directory. Trying to get an overview here what works and for what part of world 2 it's usable.

A lot of clouds, Tux has to make his way up. 

Difficulty:
:I can't make the jumps so i never solved the level. Either i use 'run' the i slip off the next cloud or i don't then the jump is too short. If you fail a jump you are dead or you have to do a lot of thouse jumps yet another time. Too frustrating, way too hard. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:32, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

Tux has to climb some trees.

Difficulty:
:One or two jumps are a bit tricky. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

== fish.stl ==
Fishponds in the forest.

Difficulty:
:My plan was to create a easy level. If you want all coins it's a bit more complicated. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

Solvable. Easy. A bit short. Wasn't there a similar level on Giana?
: IIRC sommer (I think it was sommer at least) said he made this level like some level in another game. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 14:35, 4 Jul 2006 (BST)

== trees.stl ==

Forest,level startig on the right.

Difficulty:
:IMO easy, but I got some training while making it. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

== village.stl ==
A village in the light forest. Tux has to use a switch to solve the level. Use camera to give hint about switch and it's effect so it should not me too hard to figure out.

Difficulty:
:I think it's medium but I played the level a lot while designing it. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:36, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)
:Somewhere between medium and easy I would say. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:53, 6 Jul 2006 (BST)

=== Mini-Review 1 ===

* Can be beat: yes
* Difficuly: Slightly easier than "Nolok's Castle"
* Rough edges: Tube doesn't cover Tux (won't fix without new tiles)
* Time to beat: 1:01 (without waiting for platform)

Praise:
* Straightforward
* Introduces "color" hint signs

Critique:
* Solid wood as a background tile is confusing
* Having to wait for the platform is boring and complicates speedruns
* Jump from roof to roof (without using invisible bonus blocks) is too hard. One shouldn't need the "bonus" blocks.
