There are many levels in svn's World 2 directory. Trying to get an overview here what works and for what part of world 2 it's usable.

=== Mini-Review 3 ===

* Revision tested at: 3927
* Can be beat: yes
* Difficulty: Slightly harder than "Nolok's Castle"
* Rough edges: None that I noticed.
* Time to beat: 01:45 (speedrun)

Praise:
* Nice jumps (most of them).
* Right mix of jumps/badguys/puzzel (mostly).
* Good use of spikes (mostly).

Critique:
* Jumping up and down on a moving platform to avoid the darts is too hard
* A jump just after the the end of the first group of moving platforms are too hard (between those dark green things)
* Sometimes a bit too many [[Zeekling]]s at the same time.

== christoph5.stl ==
=== Mini-Review 4 ===

* Revision tested at: 3927
* Can be beat: yes
* Difficulty: Quite a bit harder than "Nolok's Castle"
* Rough edges: Pass only as smalltux in some places.
* Time to beat: 02:00 (speedrun)

Praise:
* "Right" amount of badguys.
* Good use of spikes (mostly).
* Very fun bridge.
* No extremely hard jumps.

Critique:
* Near the end of the level there are some spikes, most of them are good but some are too hard as you can't pass them as bigtux.

== christoph6.stl ==
Tux has to make his way through a wall and up in the clouds.

Status: playable (door size does no longer match, you have to jump to trigger end of level)

Difficulty:
::easy/medium. Can be completed in <2min.--[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 00:57, 7 Jul 2006 (BST)

== christoph7.stl ==

== christoph8.stl ==

== christoph9.stl ==

== detour.stl ==
Tux has to climb some trees.

Difficulty:
:One or two jumps are a bit tricky. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

Update r3937. Longer, more coin trails. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 03:13, 8 Jul 2006 (BST)

Update r4039: Two more signs right at the beginning to avoid the dead end. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 18:18, 17 Jul 2006 (BST)

== dfk-level1.stl ==

== dfk-level2.stl ==

== dfk-level3.stl ==

== dfk-placeholder-1.stl ==

== fish.stl ==
Fishponds in the forest.

Difficulty:
:My plan was to create a easy level. If you want all coins it's a bit more complicated. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)


=== Mini-Review 2 ===

* Can be beat: yes
* Difficulty: about halfway through MS1
* Rough edges: Tube doesn't cover Tux (won't fix without new tiles)
* Time to beat: 0:22

Praise:
* Introduces dispenser (fun!)

Critique:
* Way too much bonus (165 coins are six extra lives and that's only from the coins)
* Feels a bit short

--[[User:Sommer|Sommer]]

Update: extended in r3957. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 19:52, 8 Jul 2006 (BST)

Update r4038: Main level is one sector again. Less badguys, removed dispenser, made some jumps simpler. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 18:20, 17 Jul 2006 (BST)

== forest1-grumbel.stl ==

tile test level, not playable, demonstrates how to add some variety to monotonus forest tiles

== owls_revenge.stl ==

Solvable. Easy. A bit short. Wasn't there a similar level on Giana?
: IIRC sommer (I think it was sommer at least) said he made this level like some level in another game. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 14:35, 4 Jul 2006 (BST)

== trees.stl ==

Forest, level starting on the right.

Difficulty:
:IMO easy, but I got some training while making it. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

== village.stl ==
A village in the light forest. Tux has to use a switch to solve the level. Use camera to give hint about switch and it's effect so it should not me too hard to figure out.

Difficulty:
:I think it's medium but I played the level a lot while designing it. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:36, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)
:Somewhere between medium and easy I would say. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:53, 6 Jul 2006 (BST)

=== Mini-Review 1 ===

* Can be beat: yes
* Difficulty: Slightly easier than "Nolok's Castle"
* Rough edges: Tube doesn't cover Tux (won't fix without new tiles)
* Time to beat: 1:01 (without waiting for platform)

Praise:
* Straightforward
* Introduces "color" hint signs

Critique:
* Solid wood as a background tile is confusing
* Having to wait for the platform is boring and complicates speedruns
* Jump from roof to roof (without using invisible bonus blocks) is too hard. One shouldn't need the "bonus" blocks.

--[[User:Sommer|Sommer]]

Update: r3932 should fix most of the problems.--[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 21:04, 7 Jul 2006 (BST)


== updown.stl ==
Platforms. Background needs smaller tiles.

== leaves.stl ==

Forest Level. Easy standard level.

== Crumbling_Path ==
Forest Level with Unstable Tiles


== builder.stl ==


'Tux the Builder'. A forest level with some rocks.

* We might use this as an introductory level, but the first rock Tux encounters has to scream "carry me". Users already had difficulty interpreting the "Run" sign in Milestone 1, level 1, so let's make this absolutely clear :-) --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 10:35, 30 Jul 2006 (BST)
::I can add another rock near the start. If it's placed in midair it will drop down while the player is watching to make it clear that this rock is not a standard tile. If another sign next to the rock is not good enough we could mention it in the manual or add an infoblock. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 15:29, 30 Jul 2006 (BST)
::Is something like [[Media:RockHowTo-nq8.png]] self explaining or does it need additional text? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 17:05, 31 Jul 2006 (BST)
