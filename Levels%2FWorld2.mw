There are many levels in svn's World 2 directory. Trying to get an overview here what works and for what part of world 2 it's usable.

== worldmap.stwm ==

== airkey.stl ==

A lot of clouds, Tux has to make his way up. 

Status: Work in progress. 

Difficulty:
:I can't make the jumps so i never solved the level. Either i use 'run' the i slip off the next cloud or i don't then the jump is too short. If you fail a jump you are dead or you have to do a lot of thouse jumps yet another time. Too frustrating, way too hard. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:32, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)
::What places are the worst? btw, it isn't finished yet. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 14:30, 4 Jul 2006 (BST)

=== Mini-Review 3 ===

* Revision tested at: 3927
* Can be beat: yes
* Difficuly: Slightly harder than "Nolok's Castle"
* Rough edges: None that I noticed.
* Time to beat: 01:45 (speedrun)

Praise:
* Nice jumps (most of them).
* Right mix of jumps/badguys/puzzel (mostly).
* Good use of spikes (mostly).

Critique:
* Jumping up and down on a moving platform to avoid the darts is too hard
* A jump just after the the end of the first group of moving platforms are too hard (between those dark green things)
* Sometimes a bit too many [[Zeekling|Zeeklings]] at the same time.

== christoph5.stl ==
=== Mini-Review 4 ===

* Revision tested at: 3927
* Can be beat: yes
* Difficuly: Quite a bit harder than "Nolok's Castle"
* Rough edges: Pass only as smalltux in some places.
* Time to beat: 02:00 (speedrun)

Praise:
* "Right" amount of badguys.
* Good use of spikes (mostly).
* Very fun bridge.
* No extremly hard jumps.

Critique:
* Near the end of the level there are some spikes, most of them are good but some are too hard as you can't pass them as bigtux.

== christoph6.stl ==
Tux has to make his way through a wall and up in the clouds.

Status: playable (door size does no longer match, you have to jump to trigger end of level)

Difficulty: 
::easy/medium. Can be completed in <2min.--[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 00:57, 7 Jul 2006 (BST)
== christoph7.stl ==

== christoph8.stl ==

== christoph9.stl ==

== detour.stl ==
Tux has to climb some trees.

Difficulty:
:One or two jumps are a bit tricky. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

== dfk-level1.stl ==

== dfk-level2.stl ==

== dfk-level3.stl ==

== dfk-placeholder-1.stl ==

== fish.stl ==
Fishponds in the forest.

Difficulty:
:My plan was to create a easy level. If you want all coins it's a bit more complicated. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)


=== Mini-Review 2 ===

* Can be beat: yes
* Difficuly: about halfway through MS1
* Rough edges: Tube doesn't cover Tux (won't fix without new tiles)
* Time to beat: 0:22

Praise:
* Introduces dispenser (fun!)

Critique:
* Way too much bonus (165 coins are six extra lives and that's only from the coins)
* Feels a bit short

== owls_revenge.stl ==

Solvable. Easy. A bit short. Wasn't there a similar level on Giana?
: IIRC sommer (I think it was sommer at least) said he made this level like some level in another game. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 14:35, 4 Jul 2006 (BST)

== trees.stl ==

Forest,level startig on the right.

Difficulty:
:IMO easy, but I got some training while making it. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:46, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)

== village.stl ==
A village in the light forest. Tux has to use a switch to solve the level. Use camera to give hint about switch and it's effect so it should not me too hard to figure out.

Difficulty:
:I think it's medium but I played the level a lot while designing it. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 16:36, 3 Jul 2006 (BST)
:Somewhere between medium and easy I would say. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:53, 6 Jul 2006 (BST)

=== Mini-Review 1 ===

* Can be beat: yes
* Difficuly: Slightly easier than "Nolok's Castle"
* Rough edges: Tube doesn't cover Tux (won't fix without new tiles)
* Time to beat: 1:01 (without waiting for platform)

Praise:
* Straightforward
* Introduces "color" hint signs

Critique:
* Solid wood as a background tile is confusing
* Having to wait for the platform is boring and complicates speedruns
* Jump from roof to roof (without using invisible bonus blocks) is too hard. One shouldn't need the "bonus" blocks.

Update: r3932 should fix most of the problems.--[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 21:04, 7 Jul 2006 (BST)
