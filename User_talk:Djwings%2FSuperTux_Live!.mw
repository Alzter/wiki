== SuperTux Live! 2.0 ==

For STL! 2, I`d like to completely redo the base system. I`m thinking a [http://www.gentoo.org Gentoo]-based system with Enlightenment DR17 and Fluxbox, compiled for i586 (Pentium) and -Os (optimize for binary size)? --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]]: N0 PH33R 14:59, 15 April 2007 (UTC)

Why not add a your live CD to the [[Links]] instead of posting every update to the Supertux development wiki? Yes, great job and all, but like the changelog for every other distribution that ships Supertux this does not really belong here. Or is this part of the Supertux development, not a fan project? --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 20:38, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

As far as I know it is a fan project. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 18:43, 17 April 2007 (UTC)
