SuperTux extra is a modification of SuperTux 0.1.3 by Narre that has a full story. There are total 6 worlds:
# Narreland
# IcyIsland
# ForestIsland
# Lavaland
# Giant chewinggum
# Vomitland
The first release is in English ([http://www.uloz.to/xtoiK8Xu/stex-exe Download here]) and the secound release is in Czech ([http://www.uloz.to/xqFHX6Nf/install-super-tux-extra-2-exe Download here]). The third release was planned, but SuperTux extra will be combined with SuperTux 0.3.4, because SuperTux hasn't a full story jet. The combination is planned in SuperTux 0.3.5. It's not known, how similar would be the levels in SuperTux extra and they equivalents in SuperTux 0.3.5. It looks like, they will have only the same name (13th July 2013).
