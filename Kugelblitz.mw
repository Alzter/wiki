The Kugelblitz ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_lightning "ball lightning"]) falls from the sky without warning; as soon as it hits the ground, it starts moving back and forth randomly for about two or three seconds, then vanishes with a pop in a cloud of smoke. Explodes on contact which hurts Tux.

The Kugelblitz cannot be hurt, the player has to avoid its radius until it's gone. It looks like a yellowish glowing wheel with animations for falling (with glowing trail), rolling, exploding and vanishing in smoke. It can be used in Ghost Forest and Forest Castle settings.

(I chose the German name because it's one of the few words that actually sounds cooler in German than in English, IMHO.)
