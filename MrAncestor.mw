(or Mrs Ancestor)

Behaviour: a painted figure trying to hurt Tux from out of his frame when he gets close, either by reaching out/grabbing him or by screaming at him

Look: Image in gold frame mounted to the wall. Pale, ghostly, medieval looking characters, either male (knight in armour) or female (long-haired woman in dress). Male images reach out for Tux when he comes near, females scream at him as soon as he walked past the image (draw sound waves). Use Ancestor in a row of harmless paintings that look almost the same (a little less ghostly)

Hurt Tux: contact with knight's arm, or lady's sound waves

Hurt it: invincible
