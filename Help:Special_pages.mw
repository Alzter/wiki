{{PD Help Page}}
'''Special pages''' are pages that are created by the software on demand. They are located in their own [[Help:Namespaces|namespace]] ''Special:'' and are not editable directly as other pages. 

Some special pages depend on the [[Help:Preferences|preferences]] that have been set by a user, e.g. the number of titles which is displayed on a user's [[Help:Watchlist|watchlist]].
