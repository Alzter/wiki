{{Milestone 2}}
A '''rock''' is a small [[Objects|object]] that [[Tux]] can pick up and move around. Tux can walk on rocks, so they are useful to reach high places. Both Tux and enemies are hurt if a rock falls on their head.

For a sample, see the level [http://supertux.lethargik.org/svn/supertux/trunk/supertux/data/levels/world2/builder.stl world2/builder.stl] (in 0.3.0 and up).
