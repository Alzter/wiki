= Things to do for a Milestone 1.9 release =

Basically, this should be the current SVN version (as of today) minus everything that doesn't work yet (The only thing we might want to fix are infoblocks)
We will include a few (about five) World2 levels to playtest and show off features, but the main storyline will have to wait for MS2.

This is a list of what should be '''Added''', '''Removed''' or '''Fixed''' for MS2. We will also need to '''Build''' packages of both game and editor for a number of platforms and publish a list of '''Known Bugs'''.

== Add ==
* "This is a known bug" infoblocks where necessary
    
== Remove ==
* Intro cutscene (replace with placeholder, i.e. current cutscene showing the game logo, no penny etc.)
* Floating in water
* Iceflower
* Keys
* Code for horribly broken objects (kugelblitz, totem, spidermite, plant, angrystone)
* Levels:
** Castle levels
** Ghost forest levels
** Levels from World2 worldmap that are not yet playable
** Levels that take advantage of Tux floating in water
** Levels that use lightmaps (except for one bonus level)
* From the editor:
** Everything we left out in the main game, too
* Incomplete translations (make the game look crappy)
