SuperTux 0.3.0, aka Milestone 1.9, was released on 2006-12-17. Although it's already fun to play, SuperTux 0.3.0 is to be considered an unstable developer preview.

SuperTux now has a full-featured official level editor, the SuperTux Editor, which was released in parallel with the game.

Being a preview build, SuperTux 0.3.0 still has some Bugs. Some of the most prominent bugs have to do with slopes. See the [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/ SuperTux Bug Tracker] page for a full listing, which is also the place to report new(!) bugs you found.

You can download Milestone 1.9 from [[Download/Installation#Release 0.3.0 (Tech Demo)|Download/Installation]].

Supertux Release 0.3.0 (2006-12-17)

Just in time for Christmas, we bring you SuperTux 0.3.0, a preview
of SuperTux Milestone 2.

This build doesn't contain all levels planned for Milestone 2 and
its story is by no means complete, but the game is already fun to
play.

SuperTux 0.3.0 features:

* new, OpenGL- and OpenAL-based engine
* final boss for Icy Island
* brand new Forest World with new badguys and new game objects
* new and improved soundtrack, immersive sound effects
* much more...

The changes in more detail: The SuperTux engine was nearly
completely rewritten. The game is translatable now, a new camera
algorithm allows scrolling in all four directions. Collision
detection supports slopes and moving objects now. We have scripting
support for dynamic level events and animations. New game objects
include trampolines, switches, portable stones, upside-down
levels, wind, moving platforms and particle effects. The sound
system is now OpenAL-based with an improved soundtrack now played
from Ogg/Vorbis-files, which were pre-rendered on a high-class
synthesizer.

This is also a call for artists and coders: If you like the game in
its current state, join us and help us finish Milestone 2!


== Feedback ==

Some points I noticed while watching my little sister playing:

* We should provide some way to make up-key for jumping still work nicely... She was really used to the 0.1.3 default keymappings...
* Some last minute changes in badguy behaviour made some iceworld levels incredibly hard! Tweak the levels again
* Enable cheat console by default... One of the first things she asked me was about cheats (because she died 10 times in a row or so in a level)
* She missed the editor
* It was not clear to her that she had to download OpenAL separately
* She liked the new music
* She liked that she could go backward now
* She liked that the game is german

Well I don't know if this is the place for posting comments, but let's go. These are things which I noticed when playing with version 0.3.0
* '''plus'''
** the linux installer worked just fine
** Tux riding on a boat is a good idea &amp; other gadgets
** the new woodworld is cool!
** it's also in German
* '''minus'''
** I almost get seasick whith the new scrolling mode. ''Please'' create at least an alternative scrolling mode where Tux is always a bit under the center (let's say at (400,200)) until he reaches the edge of a level. "Peek Left" &amp; "Peek Right" should be toggle.
** had to swap space and up-key in key settings to play it properly
** Would be nice if Mr Icecube does not get killed if he lets explode a bomb. Now you cannot sweep everything away with only one Mr Icecube (which was fun with 0.1.3).
