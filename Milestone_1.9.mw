SuperTux 0.3.0, aka Milestone 1.9, was released on 2006-12-17. Although it's already fun to play, SuperTux 0.3.0 is to be considered an unstable developer preview.

SuperTux now has a full-featured official level editor, the SuperTux Editor, which was released in parallel with the game.

Being a preview build, SuperTux 0.3.0 still has some Bugs. Some of the most prominent bugs have to do with slopes. See the [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/ SuperTux Bug Tracker] page for a full listing, which is also the place to report new(!) bugs you found.

You can download Milestone 1.9 from [[Download/Installation#Release 0.3.0 (Tech Demo)|Download/Installation]].



== Feedback ==

Some points I noticed while watching my little sister playing:

* We should provide some way to make up-key for jumping still work nicely... She was really used to the 0.1.3 default keymappings...
* Some last minute changes in badguy behaviour made some iceworld levels incredibly hard! Tweak the levels again
* Enable cheat console by default... One of the first things she asked me was about cheats (because she died 10 times in a row or so in a level)
* She missed the editor
* It was not clear to her that she had to download openal separately
* She liked the new music
* She liked that she could go backward now
* SHe liked that the game is german
