VSOpen Source Tools Available for Game Development Discussed at IGDS 2010
India Game Developer Summit 2010 â€“ First, Independent Event on Game Programming, Business and Careers

Bangalore, February 08, 2010: Industry-quality open source tools that can be utilized in the development of video games without compromising the quality of the game or the experience. Come February witness a showcase of Open Source tools that can have a huge impact on your gaming business -- not just game features, functionality, experience and quality but also the bottom line -- at India's first and independent annual summit for the game development ecosystem - India Game Developer Summit (http://www.gamedevelopersummit.com/). Indie developers Kinshuk Sunil and Yadu Rajiv say acceptance of Open Source Tools and Technologies in the gaming industry is not at an inflexion point right now, although Open Source is beginning to dominate the technology spectrum in other domains. While there can be many contributing factors for this phenomenon, one important factor is an ignorance of the open source tools and technologies. By its very nature, open source is exceptionally good and doing a splendid job, but shy enough to promote itself. At India GDS, Kinshuk and Yadu will define Open Source's context in the game development business and discuss the OS tools and technologies that can empower game developers and companies in making wise investments into their games.

They will cover the features, in general, of OS tools and technologies and look in-depth at five specific cases of open source Tools and their impact on the gaming business. They will do a comparative analysis of the Open Source tools with their rival proprietary tools and evaluate their impact on the game development lifecycle, game features and the cost of the whole exercise. They will also showcase the contribution of the tools in commercially successful projects. With this comparative analysis, the session intends to showcase how open source tools are wise investment choices for small and medium game development studios and how they make it feasible for SMEs to compete with larger development studios and work towards an AAA Title. The five tools under consideration are OGRE 3D, Open AL, Blender, Bullet and RakNet.

Kinshuk is an indie game developer from New Delhi. He has been working with many open source gaming projects since 2004. With an interest in Game Design and Player Experience, Kinshuk has been involved with the design aspects of the projects building gameplay elements, character and story. His desk job takes him into the realms of community management and social media, with active participation in open source communities across India. Yadu develops Flash games, Game Development and Graphics Programming. He leads the design initiatives and User Experience in a leading open source company and has been actively involved with the OGRE 3D and Edward engine communities.
