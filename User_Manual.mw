SuperTux is a side-scrolling 2D platformer featuring [[Tux]], the Linux mascot, but otherwise entirely unrelated to anything Linux. In the course of the game, Tux will have to make his way through lots of different levels, in order to get to and rescue [[Penny]], who got captured by evil [[Nolok]].

== Controls ==

SuperTux is played with either the keyboard or any game controller recognized by the operating system. The following list shows all controls needed to play the game, along with their default keys. Note that all of the controls can be configured in-game.

== Powerups ==

To help Tux in his quest to rescue Penny, various Powerups have been placed throughout the levels. Some are in plain view, but most are hidden in bonus blocks:

When Tux bumps a bonus block from below, he will either collect a coin or the bonus block releases one of several Powerups:

'''Milestone 2:''' Every time Tux dies, he will lose 25 coins and restart at the last firefly he activated. If he has less than 25 coins left, he will lose all of them and restart at the beginning of the level.

|-

== Actions ==

=== Running ===
Hold down the Action key while moving left or right to make Tux run faster. Jumping while running will catapult him higher into the air than usual.

=== Fireballs ===
After picking up the Fireflower, Tux will throw little fireballs when the Action button is pressed. Most badguys can be knocked off the screen by hitting them with a fireball. Also, special "straw" blocks can be set on fire by hitting them with a fireball, revealing areas with special items or opening a shortcut '''(Milestone 2 only)'''.

=== Butt Stomp (Milestone 2 only) ===
Only Big Tux has this ability. When in the air, press the Duck key to perform a Butt Stomp. Tux can use it to break wooden crates from above and defeat certain badguys that are not harmed by a normal jump.

=== Backflip (Milestone 2 only) ===
Only Big Tux has this ability. Hold down the Duck key, then press Jump to make Tux do a backflip. This will make him jump higher, which is very useful in places where there's not enough space to run.

== Badguys ==

[[Image:Mriceblock-left-2.png|right]] [[Image:Snowsnail.png|right]] [[Image:Left-1.png|right|]] [[Image:Spiky.png||right]]

In the course of the game, Tux will encounter lots of different enemies - some easy to avoid, some tough to get past. When Tux touches a badguy, he will either lose a Powerup or - if no powerups are left - get thrown off the screen. Most, but not all, of the easier enemies can easily be knocked out by jumping on their head, but take care: As a rule of thumb, enemies with a pointy top cannot be squished, but will hurt Tux, too.

== Special Game Objects ==

[[Image:Right.png|right]]

=== Firefly ===

When Tux got thrown off the screen, he will normally have to start the current level over from the beginning. There is one exception, though: Most levels contain one or more fireflies, which look like this:

[[Image:firefly1.png|center]]
and after touching them like this:
[[Image:firefly2.png|center]]

When Tux activates such a firefly, he won't have to restart the level from the beginning, but instead restart from the last activated firefly - as long as he's got at least one life '''(Milestone 1)''' or 25 coins '''(Milestone 2)''' left.

=== Doors (Milestone 2 only) ===
[[Image:Door-0.png|center]]
Press the Up key to enter a door. Tux will be transported to another place in the level.
