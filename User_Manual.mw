<p style="margin-top: 2em;">
SuperTux is a side-scrolling 2D platformer featuring [[Tux]], the Linux mascot, but otherwise entirely unrelated to anything Linux. In the course of the game, Tux will have to make his way through lots of different levels, in order to get to and rescue [[Penny]], who got captured by evil [[Nolok]].

== Powerups ==

To help Tux in his quest to rescue Penny, various powerups have been placed throughout the levels. Some are in plain view, but most are hidden in bonus blocks:

[[Image:Bonusblock.png|center|Bonus Block]]

When Tux bumps a bonus block from below, he will either collect a coin or the bonus block releases one of several powerups:

|-
| [[Image:Coin-0.png]] || Coin || '''SuperTux 0.1:''' Collect 100 coins to gain an extra life. '''SuperTux 0.3:''' Every time Tux dies, he will restart at the last firefly he activated.
|-
| [[Image:Egg.png]] || Egg || Makes Tux grow. He can then smash wooden boxes with his head.
|-
| [[Image:Fire_flower-0.png]] || Fireflower || Only released from bonus blocks when Tux has already picked up an Egg. This will give Tux the power to throw fireballs.
|-

== Actions ==

=== Running (SuperTux 0.1) ===
Press the Action button and keep running in the same direction. Tux will go faster and jump higher. If you release the Action button while running, Tux will walk at a slower pace again.

=== Walking (SuperTux 0.3) ===
Normally, when you keep running in the same direction, Tux will go faster and jump higher. If you press the Action button while running, Tux will walk at a slower pace again.

=== Fireballs ===
After picking up the [[Fireflower]], Tux will throw little fireballs when the Action button is pressed. Most badguys can be knocked off the screen by hitting them with a fireball. Also, special "straw" blocks can be set on fire by hitting them with a fireball, revealing areas with special items or opening a shortcut '''(SuperTux 0.3 only)'''.

=== Butt Stomp (SuperTux 0.3.3 and later) ===
Only Big and Fire Tux have this ability. When in the air, press the Duck key to perform a Butt Stomp. Tux can use it to break wooden crates from above and defeat certain badguys that are not harmed by a normal jump.

=== Backflip (SuperTux 0.3 only) ===
Only Big and Fire Tux have this ability. Hold down the Duck key, then press Jump to make Tux do a backflip. This will make him jump as high as he would when running, which is very useful in places where there's not enough space to run. Note that in 0.3.0, but not 0.3.1, Fire Tux will lose his hat when doing a backflip.

=== Carrying Objects ===
[[Image:needrock.png|left]]
Some objects Tux comes across can be picked up and carried around. This includes a squished [[MrIceBlock|Mr. IceBlock]] ('''SuperTux 0.1''' and '''SuperTux 0.3'''), a [[Rock]] ('''SuperTux 0.3''') and a [[Trampoline]] ('''SuperTux 0.3''').

To pick a portable object up, hold down the Action button and walk into the object. Tux will then carry the object as long as the Action button is held down.

== Badguys ==
{{See also|[[Badguys]]}}

[[Image:Left-1.png|right]] [[Image:Mriceblock new.png|right]] [[Image:Spiky.png||right]] [[Image:Snowsnail.png|right]]

In the course of the game, Tux will encounter lots of different enemies – some easy to avoid, some tough to get past. When Tux touches a badguy, he will either lose a Powerup or –&nbsp;if no powerups are left&nbsp;– get thrown off the screen. Most, but not all, of the easier enemies can easily be knocked out by jumping on their head, but take care: As a rule of thumb, enemies with a pointy top cannot be squished, and will hurt Tux, too. Fireballs can take out most of them, but beware: Some badguys are even immune to those.

For more information on the occurring badguys, please take a look at the [[Badguys|Badguys page]].

== Special Game Objects ==

=== Bells ===
[[Image:bell-r.png|right]]
When Tux gets thrown off the screen, he will normally have to start the current level over from the beginning. There is one exception, though: Most levels contain one or more bells. When Tux activates such a bell, by touching it, he won't have to restart the level from the beginning, but instead restart from the last activated bell - as long as he's got at least one life '''(SuperTux 0.1)''' or 25 coins '''(SuperTux 0.3)''' left. In SuperTux 0.1, bells are invisible, but don't need to be touched to use- only passed by.

=== Secret Blocks ===
[[Image:Empty.png|right]]
Secret blocks are special blocks that appear out of thin air when Tux jumps in certain places.

They can then be stepped on to reach higher places, e.g. a secret area or a shortcut.

=== Doors (SuperTux 0.3 only) ===
[[Image:Door-0.png|right]]
Press the Up key to enter a door. Tux will be transported to another place in the level.

<br style="clear: both;" />

=== Switches (SuperTux 0.3 only) ===
[[Image:Left-0.png|right]]
Switches come in two different styles: Levers and panels.

Press the Up key to activate a switch. This might open blocked paths, start platforms, turn off a stream of air, ...

Most switches are at or near the object they affect. Objects that are further away from their switch often have a colored sign next to them.

A sign of the same color can then be found next to the corresponding switch.

=== Platforms (SuperTux 0.3 only) ===
[[Image:Flying platform-0.png|right]]

In the course of his adventure, Tux comes across a variety of moving Platforms.

Some are mounted on rails, some swim in water, some even float freely through the air.

While some platforms just move on their own, most platforms will only move when Tux steps on them.

Some might also require Tux to visit another part of the level and activate a switch first. When this is the case Tux will most probably find a helpful sign next to the platform.

=== Info Blocks (SuperTux 0.3 only) ===
[[Image:Infoblock.png|right]]

Levels that introduce new game elements often contain info blocks.

Info blocks can be bumped from below to display helpful text that introduces a certain element.

When you activated an info block, the game will pause and you can use the Up and Down buttons to scroll through the text. Press the Menu button to resume the game.

=== Trampolines (SuperTux 0.3 only) ===

Trampolines come in two flavours: A stationary version, which looks a bit like a mushroom and a portable version, which looks like a large spring. For information about carrying stuff around, see section [[#Carrying Objects|Carrying Objects]].

Normally, Tux will only bounce up and down a little bit on a trampoline. To make him jump really high, hold down the jump button when landing on the trampoline.

=== Magic Blocks and Lanterns (SuperTux 0.3 only) ===

These are blocks that look pale and are not solid unless tux brings a carryable lantern of the same color as the block near the block. The lanterns also double as a light source which allows Tux to see in dark areas.

=== Wind (SuperTux 0.3 only) ===

The Wind transports Tux in another position. Levels with Wind: "Find the Bigger Fish!", "Treasure in the skies", "Tree sheets in the wind" and "A Village in the Forest".
