The '''blowflyer''' or BalloonTux action should be a temporary limited action in which Tux fills his body with air (helium?!) and is thus able to fly for a short time, i.e. as long as he can go without breathing. The end of the flight should be announced by Tux changing color (blue?) and catching for air.

Perhaps there could be a hidden "pump" in each level, which tux could pump himself up with.
