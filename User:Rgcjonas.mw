== SuperTux Improved Editor ==
This is a fork of the SuperTux level editor. Contains some improvements.

=== Warning for Windows Users ===
The improved editor uses GtkSharp instead of sdl to load images. This reduces the amount of dll files. Unfortunately, GtkSharp 2.12.10 for Windows '''has a bug and won't load any jpeg files'''. More info: http://arsuceno.blogspot.com/2011/05/bug-in-gtk-sharp-21210-for-windows.html

You can follow one of the solutions there or downgrade to GtkSharp 2.12.9-2: ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/gtk-sharp/gtk-sharp-2.12.9-2.win32.msi

=== r8 ===
Built on Linux using Mono. Runs on both Windows and Linux. CorFlags already set.
