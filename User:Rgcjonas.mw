== SuperTux Improved Editor ==
This is a fork of the SuperTux level editor. Contains some improvements.

=== Warning for Windows Users ===
The improved editor uses GtkSharp instead of sdl to load images. This reduces the amount of dll files. Unfortunately, GtkSharp 2.12.10 for Windows '''has a bug and won't load any jpeg files'''. More info: http://arsuceno.blogspot.com/2011/05/bug-in-gtk-sharp-21210-for-windows.html

You have to do one of the following things:
* read [http://arsuceno.blogspot.com/2011/05/bug-in-gtk-sharp-21210-for-windows.html] and follow the instructions
* downgrade to GtkSharp 2.12.9-2: ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/gtk-sharp/gtk-sharp-2.12.9-2.win32.msi
OR:
* download [ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/gtk-sharp/gtk-sharp-2.12.9-2.win32.msi GtkSharp 2.12.9-2] and GtkSharp 2.12.10
* install 2.12.10
* rename C:/Program Files/GtkSharp/2.12/bin/libjpeg7.dll to libjpeg-7.dll
* repair 2.12.10 (launch the installer again and click repair)
* install/repair 2.12.9-2
* install/repair 2.12.10 again
* now it works.
