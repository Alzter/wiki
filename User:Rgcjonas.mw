== SuperTux Improved Editor ==
This is a fork of the SuperTux level editor. Contains some improvements.

https://launchpad.net/supertux-improved-editor

The following things are implemented:
* Syntax Highlighting for squirrel scripts & more text editor settings
* no need for the sdl libs anymore: The editor loads textures using Gtk.Pixbuf or System.Drawing.Bitmap, which are shipped with Gtk#/.Net Runtime => less unneeded dlls
* some bugfixes ([https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=845 ShortFuse dispenser bug], [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=461 Arrow object Drag&Drop bug], [https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=878 Property edit bug])

=== r14 ===
Built on Linux using Mono. Runs on both Windows and Linux. Can work around the [http://arsuceno.blogspot.com/2011/05/bug-in-gtk-sharp-21210-for-windows.html bug in GtkSharp for Windows] now.
