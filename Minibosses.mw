This page is for miscellaneous '''miniboss''' ideas. Any world-specific miniboss plans or ideas belong on their respective [[Worlds|world]] pages.

== Ideas ==

===Walking Trees===

===Walking Totems===

===Snowmen (not Yeti, but smaller, normal looking Snowmen)===

# They should take two hits to kill. After the second hit, the snowman loses his head. After that his state changes; he basically only runs around like an idiot for a while. If Tux doesn't kill it in a certain (small) amount of time, he kneels and make a new head from the snow on the floor.
# Basically the same concept, only they can throw their head by themselves. The head could be the standard SnowBall

===Giant Spiders===

===Giant Rats===

===Penny===

Nolok somehow makes her evil (maybe a trance, or magic or something) and gets her to fight Tux, this leaves a problem for Tux as he cant hurt penny. 
This should be saved for when Tux meets Penny sometime in each world. 
Tux can kill off the magic by throwing her enough love letters before he gets killed??

=== "Special" yeti ===

Here's one big (graphically) miniboss for the ice level. A "special" yeti near an ice bank or something similar... He makes ice-blocks in the ice bank and throw them at Tux. He can only be defeated by Tux thhrowing back the blocks at him.
