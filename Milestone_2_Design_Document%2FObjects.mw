== Reset Points ==

There shall be no reset points in the game, instead it should be made sure that levels are small enough to not require them. 

== No Lives ==

There will be no lives and no punishment for death aside from having to restart the level, due to the lack of reset points there simply is no need for lives.

== Collectibles ==

The game shall provide some form of special collectibles per level (5 special coins, 5 pieces of a crystal or stuff like that). How many of those collectibles are found is displayed in a prominent manner, not just part of the statistics. The Tux-doll (ex-1up) could be recycled for this purpose.
