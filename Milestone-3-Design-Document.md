**About this document:** This document's content should in no way be regarded
as a final decision for any feature. Any idea might be changed during its
implementation, during an IRC meeting or as a result of a bug report. However,
this will serve as a reference for potential and existing contributors.

### Overview

The main goal of Milestone 3 is to continue the story of SuperTux by improving
the Forest Island and possibly adding another world (e.g. Tropical Island) to
the game. It has also been proposed to add custom features to the levels, making
the game more interesting.

### Story

The main idea is to continue the story after Icy
Island by giving the player access to some object, like a ship, that will allow
them to continue to some smaller island in the ocean. In progress of solving
these levels, the player can collect another item (a raft has been proposed),
making it possible for the player to continue their trip to Forest Island.

However, using the raft to get to another island won't be possible as there
might be heavy currents in the ocean, causing it to sink.

Similar, but different, scenarios for other worlds are possible: using a plane
to reach a mountain range, but not being able to fly over because it's too
high, ...

### Shop

A shop could be accessible via the worldmap, being located on every big island
once or twice. The shop could be implemented as a lighthouse on the coast of the
island. The shopkeeper (e.g. an old walrus with a beard) will provide the player
items (power-ups limited to the shop) and services (unlock a level) in exchange
for coins or items that can be collected only one time in secret areas of levels.
