SuperTux is a side-scrolling 2D platformer featuring
Tux wikilink, the Linux mascot, but it's otherwise entirely
unrelated to Linux. Over the course of the game, Tux will have to make
his way through many different levels, in order to reach and rescue Penny, who was captured by evil
Nolok.



Controls
--------

Powerups
--------

To help Tux in his quest to rescue Penny, various powerups have been
placed throughout the levels. Some are in plain view, but most are
hidden in bonus blocks:

![Bonus Block](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/b/b8/Bonusblock.png "Bonus Block")

When Tux bumps a bonus block from below, he will either collect a coin
or the bonus block will release one of several powerups:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/4/48/Coin-0.png "Coin-0.png")                 Coin                                  **SuperTux 0.1:** Collect 100 coins to gain an extra life. **SuperTux 0.3:** Every time Tux dies, he will restart at the last firefly he activated.
                                                                                     

  ![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/2/26/Egg.png "Egg.png")                       Egg                                   Makes Tux grow. He can then smash wooden boxes with his head and perform a *backflip* (see below).
                                                                                     

  ![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/d/dd/Fire_flower-0.png "Fire_flower-0.png")   [Fireflower](Fireflower "wikilink")   Only released from bonus blocks when Tux has already picked up an Egg. This will give Tux the power to throw fireballs. In SuperTux 0.1 you can shoot more than two at a time. In SuperTux 0.3 you can shoot them at once as many as you collected.
                                                                                     

  ![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/6/6a/Ice_flower.png "Ice flower.png")         [Iceflower](Iceflower "wikilink")     Similar to the Fireflower, but shoots iceballs instead of fireballs. If an enemy is hit, it will be frozen. Does not work on most snow and ice enemies. **(unstable)**
                                                                                     

  ![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/7/76/1up.png "1up.png")                       Tux Doll                              Ejected from the bonus block and needs to be caught before falling off the screen. If Tux manages to catch it, he is awarded an extra life **(SuperTux 0.1)** or 100 coins **(SuperTux 0.3)**.
                                                                                     

  ![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/1/15/Star-0.png "Star-0.png")                 Star                                  Gives Tux invincibility to most hazards for a short amount of time.
                                                                                     
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Actions
-------

### Running (SuperTux 0.1)

Press the Action button and keep running in the same direction. Tux will
go faster and jump higher. If you release the Action button while
running, Tux will walk at a slower pace again.

### Walking (SuperTux 0.3)

Normally, when you keep running in the same direction, Tux will go
faster and jump higher. If you press the Action button while running,
Tux will walk at a slower pace again.

### Fireballs

After picking up the [Fireflower](Fireflower "wikilink"), Tux will throw
fireballs when the Action button is pressed. Most badguys can be knocked
off the screen by hitting them with a fireball. Also, special "Straw"
blocks can be set on fire by hitting them with a fireball, revealing
areas with special items or opening a shortcut **(SuperTux 0.3 only)**.

### Iceballs (SuperTux 0.3.1 and later)

Similar to the Fireballs, but objects which they hit freeze. It only
works on "MrBomb", "Jump ", "Spiky", "Fish", "Haywire". They are also
frozen when they are hit by a falling "Stalactite".

### Butt Stomp (SuperTux 0.3.3 and later)

Only Big and Fire Tux have this ability. When in the air, press the Duck
key to perform a Butt Stomp. Tux can use this ability to break wooden
crates from above and defeat certain badguys that are not harmed by a
normal jump.

### Backflip (SuperTux 0.3 only)

Only Big and Fire Tux have this ability. Hold down the Duck key, then
press Jump to make Tux do a backflip. This will make him jump as high as
he would when running, which is very useful in places where there's not
enough space to run. Note that in 0.3.0, but not 0.3.1, Fire Tux will
lose his hat when doing a backflip.

### Carrying Objects

![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/e/e3/Needrock.png "fig:needrock.png") Some objects Tux comes across can
be picked up and carried around. This includes a squished Mr.
IceBlock (**SuperTux 0.1** and **SuperTux
0.3**), a Rock (**SuperTux 0.3**), a
Trampoline (**SuperTux 0.3**) and a Mr.
Bomb (**SuperTux 0.3.3**)

To pick up a portable object, hold down the Action button and walk into
the object. Tux will then carry the object as long as the Action button
is held down.



Badguys
-------

![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/e/ed/Left-1.png "fig:Left-1.png")
![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/e/e1/Mriceblock_new.png "fig:Mriceblock new.png")
![|right](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/5/5a/Spiky.png "fig:|right") ![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/7/70/Snowsnail.png "fig:Snowsnail.png")

Over the course of the game, Tux will encounter lots of different
enemies – some easy to avoid, some tough to get past. When Tux touches a
badguy, he will either lose a Powerup or – if no powerups are left – get
thrown off the screen. Most, but not all, of the easier enemies can
easily be knocked out by jumping on their head, but take care: As a rule
of thumb, enemies with a pointy top cannot be squished, and if he tries,
it will hurt him. Fireballs can take out most badguys, but beware: Some
badguys are even immune to those.

Special Game Objects
--------------------

### Bells

![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/9/99/Bell-r.png "fig:bell-r.png") When Tux gets thrown off the screen, he
will normally have to start the current level over from the beginning.
There is one exception, though: Most levels contain one or more bells.
When Tux activates a Bell by touching it, he won't have to restart the
level from the beginning, but will instead restart from the last
activated bell - as long as he has at least one life **(SuperTux 0.1)**
or 25 coins **(SuperTux 0.3)** left. In SuperTux 0.1, bells are
invisible, but don't need to be touched to use- only passed by.

### Secret Blocks

![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/5/59/Empty.png "fig:Empty.png") Secret blocks are special blocks that
appear out of thin air when Tux jumps in certain places.

They can then be stepped on to reach higher places, e.g. a secret area
or a shortcut.

appart from that they do nothing, you can stand on them.

### Doors (SuperTux 0.3 only)

![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/6/67/Door-0.png "fig:Door-0.png") Press the Up key to enter a door. Tux
will be transported to another place in the level.


### Switches (SuperTux 0.3 only)

![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/7/74/Left-0.png "fig:Left-0.png") Switches come in two different styles:
Levers and panels.

Press the Up key to activate a switch. This might open blocked paths,
start platforms, turn off a stream of air, etc.

Most switches are near the object they affect. Objects that are farther
away from their switch often have a colored sign next to them. A sign of
the same color can then be found next to the corresponding switch.

### Platforms (SuperTux 0.3 only)

![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Flying_platform-0.png "Flying platform-0.png")

Over the course of his adventure, Tux comes across a variety of moving
Platforms.

Some are mounted on rails, some swim in water, some even float freely
through the air.

While some Platforms just move on their own, most Platforms will only
move when Tux steps on them.

Some might also require Tux to visit another part of the level and
activate a Switch first. When this is the case Tux will most probably
find a helpful sign next to the Platform.

### Info Blocks (SuperTux 0.3 only)

![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/c/cb/Infoblock.png "Infoblock.png")

Levels that introduce new game elements often contain Info Blocks.

Info Blocks can be bumped from below to display helpful text that
introduces a certain element.

When you activate an Info Block, the game will pause and you can use the
Up and Down buttons to scroll through the text. Press the Menu button to
resume the game.

they are really useful. make sure to bop one if you see it.

### Trampolines (SuperTux 0.3 only)

![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/1/1a/Trampoline1-0.png "fig:trampoline1-0.png")
![](http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/images/6/64/Trampoline2-0.png "fig:trampoline2-0.png")

Trampolines come in two flavors: A stationary version, which looks a bit
like a mushroom and a portable version, which looks like a large spring.


Normally, Tux will only bounce up and down a small amount on a
Trampoline. To make him jump higher, hold down the jump button when
landing on the Trampoline.


### Magic Blocks and Lanterns (SuperTux 0.3 only)

Magic Blocks look pale and are not solid unless Tux brings a carry-able
Lantern that is the same color as the block near the block. Lanterns
also double as a light source which allows Tux to see in dark areas.

### Wind (SuperTux 0.3 only)

The Wind transports Tux to another location. Levels with Wind: "Find the
Bigger Fish!", "Treasure in the skies", "Tree sheets in the wind" and "A
Village in the Forest".
