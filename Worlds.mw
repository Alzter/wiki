== Worlds in SuperTux extra ==
more about [[SuperTux extra]]<br>
As Official released are long to come because of the lack of coders for implementing new function and new element, some players made a fork from Milestone1 compatible with Milestone1.9 and using elements from coming Milestone2 and some extra-elements they designed. They are for most of them available as download but won't be merged with the official levels set. 
The SuperTux Extra Is more concentrated on Level design that code evolution/maintenance… Both project coexist pacifically. 


=== Before combination ===
* World 1 - Narreland (Narrejská země)
* [[World 1|World 2 - Icyisland (Ledová země)]]
* World 3 - Forestisland (Lesní země)
* World 4 - Lavaland (Lávová země)
* World 5 - Gigant chewinggum (Obří žvýkačka)
* World 6 - Vomitland (Země zvratků)

=== After combination ===
This is only planned. It can be whenever changed. Giant chewinggum and Vomitland will be ignored, because they are unreaonable.
* [[World 1|World 1 - Icyisland]]
* [[World 2|World 2 - Forest]]
* [[World 3|World 3 - Jungle]]
* [[World 4|World 4 - Crystal cave]] (instead of Narreland)
* [[World 5|World 5 - Lavaland]]
* <strike>World 6 - Giant chewinggum</strike>
* <strike>World 7 - Vomitland</strike>
