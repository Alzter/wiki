__NOTOC__

= Summary =
This module contains methods controlling the player. (No, SuperTux doesn't use mind control. Player refers to the type of the player object.)

'''Once again, just like with [[ScriptingScriptedObject|ScriptedObject]], note that <tt>Player</tt> is only the object type. Since SuperTux is currently single-player only, use <tt>Tux</tt> to make changes to the player object, such as <tt>Tux.deactivate()</tt>.'''

= Methods =
