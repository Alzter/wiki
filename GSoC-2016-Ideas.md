Even though it's still unclear whether SuperTux will be accepted into
[GSoC 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), this page should serve as a
list of potential ideas for students. This is not an exact plan, and changes can
be proposed. The page can also be used to coordinate mentor assignments.

The following ideas have been proposed by the SuperTux development team:
* multi-player mode for SuperTux. This includes two players playing against each other the same level during the same time.
* font improvements. Currently our font system is based on a series of images which contain each of the glyphs. In order to speed up loading of fonts and to improve the look of the glyphs, using a TTF rendering library, such as SDL_ttf or Freetype for rendering.
* OpenGL ES support: In order to bring SuperTux to lower-spec devices, it would be great if OpenGL ES could be supported.
