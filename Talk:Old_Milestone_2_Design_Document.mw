Can someone tell me more about this joystick buttons as axis? I've never seen such a thing. Is it that common that it warrants an own point in the menu? Or  would be enough to support it with an entry in the config file?<br>

== Multi Player ==

How about to put a multi-player option?
I think that is interesting to have a 2 player game in the same keyboard at home.
The camera can have the center in the center of the 2 penguins and they can't to stay away more then the screen width.

Thanks, Aurium

== Ice shot ==

What would the ice shot do?
Would it be like the standar fireball going straith? or would it be a freezer like in metroid so you could use frost enemies as platforms (and maybe destroyable through butt jump or a second ice shot)? the last one could be cool ----

== OpenGL ==

Can you rethink about using OpenGL? If this becomes a requirement you are going to lose part of your userbase... Is not like the Snes had 3d hardware and zsnes works in 2d just fine.
