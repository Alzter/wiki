Can someone tell me more about this joystick buttons as axis? I've never seen such a thing. Is it that common that it warrants an own point in the menu? Or  would be enough to support it with an entry in the config file?<br>

== Multi Player ==

How about to put a multi-player option?
I think that is interesting to have a 2 player game in the same keyboard at home.
The camera can have the center in the center of the 2 penguins and they can't to stay away more then the screen width.

Thanks, Aurium

== SVG Sprites ==

How about to use SVG images for the sprites, like Gnome and KDE Games? It will be very good to make the game suitable for all dimensions (from Nokia 700 to an big 16x9 fullscreen). I can draw something...

Thanks, Aurium

== Ice shot ==

What would the ice shot do?
Would it be like the standar fireball going straith? or would it be a freezer like in metroid so you could use frost enemies as platforms (and maybe destroyable through butt jump or a second ice shot)? the last one could be cool ----

== OpenGL ==

Can you rethink about using OpenGL? If this becomes a requirement you are going to lose part of your userbase... Is not like the Snes had 3d hardware and zsnes works in 2d just fine.
:That would mean to test everything with two graphic drivers and keeping them in sync. Do you volunteer for that job? Btw, are YOU playing  on a machine without OpenGL support? Or do you just think that there might be somweone out there that does?
