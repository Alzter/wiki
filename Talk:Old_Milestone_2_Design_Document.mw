Can someone tell me more about this joystick buttons as axis? I've never seen such a thing. Is it that common that it warrants an own point in the menu? Or  would be enough to support it with an entry in the config file?<br>

== Multi Player ==

How about to put a multi-player option?

I think that is interesting to have a 2 player game in the same keyboard at home.

The camera can have the center in the center of the 2 penguins and they can't to stay away more then the screen width.

Thanks,
