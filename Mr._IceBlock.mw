'''Mr. IceBlock''' is a [[badguy]] in [[Icy Island]] with moderately complex behavior. In his ordinary form, he works like an ordinary walking badguy, turning around upon reaching walls and falling off cliffs. In version 0.3 and above, he only walks off a cliff if there is something safe on which he can land.

When stomped on for the first time, Mr. IceBlock suddenly stops short. If he is not stomped again for the next few seconds, he returns back to normal. However, if he is stomped once more while squished, he suddenly skids rapidly in one direction, hurting all creatures that he hits. When skidding, he bounces off walls and falls off cliffs. If another creature (including Tux) can stomp on him while he is skidding, he stops short once more.
