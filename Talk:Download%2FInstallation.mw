Could someone _please_ make a binary for OS X available? I'm addicted and didn't get the source file running. Please hurry up!

I read one the email newsletter that someone made the binary for OS X...where is it?!  I cannot live knowing there is a 0.1.3 out there while I have run my now-obsolete 0.1.2.  (Somewhat joking...)

== BeOS Version does not work ==
so I build a Version 0.1.3 for Zeta, it also works with R5

somebody removed my previous comment! not nice

== Mac OS Version ==

Is someone working on a Mac distribution. I tried to install all of the required packages repeatedly, but somehow my vorbis installation is messed up. I have tried reinstalling it and it doesn't let me compile the source. I would really like to play the new levels, but I am entirely dependent on someone else compiling a binary. Thank you to whoever that kind soul is.

== Install supertux 0.1.3 on Mac OS X.  HowTo: ==
This is probably not the best solution around but at least I got a working supertux 0.1.3 now :-)
Do this (You should now how to handle the Terminal and even better Fink, otherwise better wait for a package:

Get the source and untar it.<br/>
Install Fink (fink.sf.org)<br/>
in Terminal install the following binaries through Fink:<br/>
%fink install sdl<br/>
%fink install sdl_image<br/>
%fink install sdl_mixer<br/>

then go to your untared copy of supertux and do this:<br/>
%./configure --disable-opengl<br/>
make<br/>

once everything is compiled, go to the src directory inside your supertux directory and type in Termianl:<br/>
./supertux -d ../data/<br/>

Now it should be working!

PS: OpenGL is not enabled in this mode. Didn't work, had compiling errors with that. There are probably ways to have a package that works like 0.1.2 but I have no clue how to compile SDL and everything into one directory. If someone can do that, go ahead.

== Windows Binary Installer? ==

Will there be a windows installer version soon?
I hope so :-)

== Linux autopackage ==

Why does the Linux autopackage under the 1.3 section link to a 1.2 package?

http://download.berlios.de/supertux/supertux-0.1.3.x86.package exists, but nobody has updated the page...please do. :) [[User:208.51.52.23|208.51.52.23]] 03:23, 18 Aug 2005 (BST)
