== SuperTux 0.1.3 for FreeBSD==
[http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=supertux&stype=all]

== SuperTux 0.1.3 for Mac OS X ==
 
:Could you also post the xcode project for this or how you compiled it?

== Mac OS Version ==

Is someone working on a Mac distribution. I tried to install all of the required packages repeatedly, but somehow my vorbis installation is messed up. I have tried reinstalling it and it doesn't let me compile the source. I would really like to play the new levels, but I am entirely dependent on someone else compiling a binary. Thank you to whoever that kind soul is.

El == instala el supertux 0.1.3 en OS X. HowTo del Mac: El == ihyigvbuikjoiuvhbnuecfhnygsdyigcizysgchhfhegfuefhcvbcjskshcdhfudchkzfyuefhrsgfaOYDEIGFEOHDZGFWE7RYWUDYEWEFDWIE<br/> todo se compila, va al directorio del src dentro de tu directorio del supertux y mecanografía una vez adentro Termianl: ¡<br/> ./supertux - d ../data/ <br/> ahora que debe trabajar! Picosegundo: OpenGL no se permite en este modo. No trabajó, tenía errores de compilación con eso. Hay probablemente maneras de tener un paquete que trabaje como 0.1.2 pero no tengo ninguna pista cómo compilar SDL y todo en un directorio. Si alguien puede hacer eso, ir a continuación.

== PSP problems ==

(''Comment from sandbox - moved here'')

I noticed that Supertux reveals a cursor at the top left corner while booting (this is for the PSP version)... Is there a possibility to port ermm...hmm... linux to the psp? Thanks for replying (or not)...

== Windows installer link down? ==

The Windows binary installer ([http://download.berlios.de/supertux/supertux-0.1.3-setup.exe]) seems to be down at the moment. Accessing that page displays:

<code>Too many clients for /supertux/supertux-0.1.3-setup.exe</code>

It has been doing that for quite a few days now. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 07:13, 12 Jul 2006 (BST)
:Updated: seems to happen off and on lately, must be Berlios servers overloading. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 04:09, 24 Jul 2006 (BST)
::Try [http://prdownload.berlios.de/supertux/supertux-0.1.3-setup.exe] to select mirror instead of direct link.
:::Thanks, but both mirrors seems to be full really easily too. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 22:58, 29 Jul 2006 (BST)

== Autopackage 0.1.3 link not work ==
---
The link for autopackage ([http://download.berlios.de/supertux/supertux-0.1.3.x86.package]) is not working for three days at least (as for 29 July 2006). It reports the following information

<code>Too many clients for /supertux/supertux-0.1.3.x86.package</code>.

Is it means that server is overloaded? If so, should you think of possibility to download the files from somewhere else (mirrors or third party sites). At the moment I have found the link for this package only for your site.
:Yes, the server is probably overloaded. Unfortunately, Berlios isn't like Sourceforge, where you get to choose to download from many mirror locations around the world. You will just have to refresh the page often or try again later. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 22:58, 29 Jul 2006 (BST)
