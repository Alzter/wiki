== SuperTux 0.1.3 for Mac OS X ==
 
I've posted a bundled app (including SDL frameworks) of SuperTux 0.1.3 for Mac OS X.  It runs under Panther (10.3) and Tiger (10.4), though it probably won't work under Jaguar (10.2).  Compiled with gcc 3.3.  Feel free to post and distribute!

: Thanks, I uploaded this to BerliOS and put a link on the main download page. ~~Marek

:Could you also post the xcode project for this or how you compiled it?

== BeOS Version does not work ==
so I build a Version 0.1.3 for Zeta, it also works with R5

somebody removed my previous comment! not nice

Uh... come on. '''Someone''' has to be willing to put this on the page. If the admins are this inactive, the page should be unprotected.

sorry for the slow reaction. I can give you edit rights to edit the download page and maintain the beos section in the future. Just register in the wiki and send a mail to matze@braunis.de

== Mac OS Version ==

Is someone working on a Mac distribution. I tried to install all of the required packages repeatedly, but somehow my vorbis installation is messed up. I have tried reinstalling it and it doesn't let me compile the source. I would really like to play the new levels, but I am entirely dependent on someone else compiling a binary. Thank you to whoever that kind soul is.

== Install supertux 0.1.3 on Mac OS X.  HowTo: ==
This is probably not the best solution around but at least I got a working supertux 0.1.3 now :-)
Do this (You should now how to handle the Terminal and even better Fink, otherwise better wait for a package:

Get the source and untar it.<br/>
Install Fink (fink.sf.org)<br/>
in Terminal install the following binaries through Fink:<br/>
%fink install sdl<br/>
%fink install sdl-image<br/>
%fink install sdl-mixer<br/>

then go to your untared copy of supertux and do this:<br/>
%./configure --disable-opengl<br/>
make<br/>

once everything is compiled, go to the src directory inside your supertux directory and type in Termianl:<br/>
./supertux -d ../data/<br/>

Now it should be working!

PS: OpenGL is not enabled in this mode. Didn't work, had compiling errors with that. There are probably ways to have a package that works like 0.1.2 but I have no clue how to compile SDL and everything into one directory. If someone can do that, go ahead.

== Unofficial Windows Package ==

The link to the [http://mitglied.lycos.de/jgthaler/supertux/ unofficial Windows build] seems to be down or missing. It says a note in German, which, translated in BabelFish (and reworded by me), says:
"Website missing. Sorry, but this web page no longer exists. The page will automantically redirect in 5 seconds to the Lycos Tripod homepage." --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 21:15, 24 Sep 2005 (BST)
:Still no change... --[[User:194.8.197.205|194.8.197.205]] 17:53, 27 Sep 2005 (BST)

== Unofficial Windows Package (answer) ==

I found something on this page : http://salug.hosting.cri74.org/Jeux/ (the 1.2 version).
Direkt download-link : http://salug.hosting.cri74.org/Jeux/SuperTux/supertux-0.1.2-setup.exe
This version works fine to for me.

Regards, Jojaba
:The link to download 0.1.2 (the latest official build for Windows) still works. It was the unofficial 0.1.3 Windows version, which was hosted by another site, that didn't work. Sorry if I didn't explain that more clearly earlier. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 19:26, 1 Oct 2005 (BST)

== Unofficial Windows package ==
I want to make an own 0.1.3 Windows build but i don't know how to do that. Is it any documentation for how to compile SuperTux for Windows.

--[[User:Super-Simon|Super-Simon]] 15:07, 7 Oct 2005 (BST)

There is not docu on how to compile on windows. The windows package was compiled with mingw and msys. You also need the unofficial msys jam build from the crystalspace project to compile the project. Unfortunately I don't have the time to describe all steps necessary for compilation.

I´ve found another one. Can someone check to see if it´s 0.1.3 or 0.1.2?

== Supertux .1.3 in Suse 10.0 ==
Note that Supertux .1.3 is available in Suse 10.0.

== PSP problems ==

(''Comment from sandbox - moved here'')

I noticed that Supertux reveals a cursor at the top left corner while booting (this is for the PSP version)... Is there a possibility to port ermm...hmm... linux to the psp? Thanks for replying (or not)...
