== SuperTux 0.1.3 for GP2X F100 ==
bitmage.de/index.php?section=52<br/>
archive.gp2x.de/cgi-bin/cfiles.cgi?0,0,0,0,35,1454

Download the zip with the binary in it and put it on your GP2X's SD card (unsure as to whether the NAND is fast enough). Execute.

== SuperTux 0.1.3 for Mac OS X ==
 
:Could you also post the xcode project for this or how you compiled it?

== Mac OS Version ==

Is someone working on a Mac distribution. I tried to install all of the required packages repeatedly, but somehow my vorbis installation is messed up. I have tried reinstalling it and it doesn't let me compile the source. I would really like to play the new levels, but I am entirely dependent on someone else compiling a binary. Thank you to whoever that kind soul is.

== Install supertux 0.1.3 on Mac OS X.  HowTo: ==
This is probably not the best solution around but at least I got a working supertux 0.1.3 now :-)
Do this (You should now how to handle the Terminal and even better Fink, otherwise better wait for a package:

Get the source and untar it.<br/>
Install Fink (fink.sf.org)<br/>
in Terminal install the following binaries through Fink:<br/>
%fink install sdl<br/>
%fink install sdl-image<br/>
%fink install sdl-mixer<br/>

then go to your untared copy of supertux and do this:<br/>
%./configure --disable-opengl<br/>
make<br/>

once everything is compiled, go to the src directory inside your supertux directory and type in Termianl:<br/>
./supertux -d ../data/<br/>

Now it should be working!

PS: OpenGL is not enabled in this mode. Didn't work, had compiling errors with that. There are probably ways to have a package that works like 0.1.2 but I have no clue how to compile SDL and everything into one directory. If someone can do that, go ahead.

== Downloading the OSX Univeral Binary ==

Every time I try to download the OSX UB, it tells me the server is too full. Is it jus extremely crowded or something?

==Supertux on PS3?==

Well, since the PS3's Operating System will be Linux...can Supertux be ported ?
:Theoretically, yes.  Actually, theoretically, it will Just Work.  --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 02:45, 5 Dec 2006 (CET)
