== SuperTux 0.1.3 for Mac OS X ==
 
:Could you also post the xcode project for this or how you compiled it?

== Mac OS Version ==

Is someone working on a Mac distribution. I tried to install all of the required packages repeatedly, but somehow my vorbis installation is messed up. I have tried reinstalling it and it doesn't let me compile the source. I would really like to play the new levels, but I am entirely dependent on someone else compiling a binary. Thank you to whoever that kind soul is.

== Install supertux 0.1.3 on Mac OS X.  HowTo: ==
This is probably not the best solution around but at least I got a working supertux 0.1.3 now :-)
Do this (You should now how to handle the Terminal and even better Fink, otherwise better wait for a package:

Get the source and untar it.<br/>
Install Fink (fink.sf.org)<br/>
in Terminal install the following binaries through Fink:<br/>
%fink install sdl<br/>
%fink install sdl-image<br/>
%fink install sdl-mixer<br/>

then go to your untared copy of supertux and do this:<br/>
%./configure --disable-opengl<br/>
make<br/>

once everything is compiled, go to the src directory inside your supertux directory and type in Termianl:<br/>
./supertux -d ../data/<br/>

Now it should be working!

PS: OpenGL is not enabled in this mode. Didn't work, had compiling errors with that. There are probably ways to have a package that works like 0.1.2 but I have no clue how to compile SDL and everything into one directory. If someone can do that, go ahead.

== PSP problems ==

(''Comment from sandbox - moved here'')

I noticed that Supertux reveals a cursor at the top left corner while booting (this is for the PSP version)... Is there a possibility to port ermm...hmm... linux to the psp? Thanks for replying (or not)...
