Could someone _please_ make a binary for OS X available? I'm addicted and didn't get the source file running. Please hurry up!

I read one the email newsletter that someone made the binary for OS X...where is it?!  I cannot live knowing there is a 0.1.3 out there while I have run my now-obsolete 0.1.2.  (Somewhat joking...)

== BeOS Version does not work ==
so I build a Version 0.1.3 for Zeta, it also works with R5

somebody removed my previous comment! not nice

== Mac OS Version ==

Is someone working on a Mac distribution. I tried to install all of the required packages repeatedly, but somehow my vorbis installation is messed up. I have tried reinstalling it and it doesn't let me compile the source. I would really like to play the new levels, but I am entirely dependent on someone else compiling a binary. Thank you to whoever that kind soul is.
