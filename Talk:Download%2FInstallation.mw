As I mentioned in the mailinglist Supertux fails to start under my Ubuntu Linux 5.04:

Datadir: /usr/local/bin/../share/supertux
Warning: Unable to open the file "/home/alex/.supertux/config" for read!!!

Warning: I could not set up audio for 44100 Hz 16-bit stereo.
The Simple DirectMedia error that occured was:
No available audio device

Error: I could not initialize video!
The Simple DirectMedia error that occured was:
No available video device 

The directory ~/.supertux exists in spite of that config file:


alex@alex:~/.supertux$ ls -lah
