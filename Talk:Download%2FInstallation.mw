Could someone _please_ make a binary for OS X available? I'm addicted and didn't get the source file running. Please hurry up!

I read one the email newsletter that someone made the binary for OS X...where is it?!  I cannot live knowing there is a 0.1.3 out there while I have run my now-obsolete 0.1.2.  (Somewhat joking...)

== SuperTux 0.1.3 for Mac OS X ==
 
I've posted a bundled app (including SDL frameworks) of SuperTux 0.1.3 for Mac OS X.  It runs under Panther (10.3) and Tiger (10.4), though it probably won't work under Jaguar (10.2).  Compiled with gcc 3.3.  Feel free to post and distribute!

: Thanks, I uploaded this to BerliOS and put a link on the main download page. ~~Marek

== BeOS Version does not work ==

somebody removed my previous comment! not nice

== Mac OS Version ==

Is someone working on a Mac distribution. I tried to install all of the required packages repeatedly, but somehow my vorbis installation is messed up. I have tried reinstalling it and it doesn't let me compile the source. I would really like to play the new levels, but I am entirely dependent on someone else compiling a binary. Thank you to whoever that kind soul is.

== Install supertux 0.1.3 on Mac OS X.  HowTo: ==
This is probably not the best solution around but at least I got a working supertux 0.1.3 now :-)
Do this (You should now how to handle the Terminal and even better Fink, otherwise better wait for a package:

Get the source and untar it.<br/>
Install Fink (fink.sf.org)<br/>
in Terminal install the following binaries through Fink:<br/>
%fink install sdl<br/>
%fink install sdl_image<br/>
%fink install sdl_mixer<br/>

then go to your untared copy of supertux and do this:<br/>
%./configure --disable-opengl<br/>
make<br/>

once everything is compiled, go to the src directory inside your supertux directory and type in Termianl:<br/>
./supertux -d ../data/<br/>

Now it should be working!

PS: OpenGL is not enabled in this mode. Didn't work, had compiling errors with that. There are probably ways to have a package that works like 0.1.2 but I have no clue how to compile SDL and everything into one directory. If someone can do that, go ahead.

==Mac OS X. XCode Project==
I have provided an XCode Project here: http://cocoa.sprachwerker.de/download/supertux013

It does not yet compile because there seems to be something wrong with texture.cpp. So if you know what to do, go ahead and fix it. BTW, this is an XCode 2.1 Project, so it might not run on 10.3. Sorry for that, I have no clue how to make it 10.3 compatible.

== Windows Binary Installer? ==

Will there be a windows installer version soon?
I hope so :-)

== Linux autopackage ==

Why does the Linux autopackage under the 1.3 section link to a 1.2 package?

http://download.berlios.de/supertux/supertux-0.1.3.x86.package exists, but nobody has updated the page...please do. :) [[User:208.51.52.23|208.51.52.23]] 03:23, 18 Aug 2005 (BST)

: Done, thanks for pointing out. ~Marek
