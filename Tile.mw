= Introduction =

Supertux levels are composed from tiles. Little 32x32 pixel wide images. These tiles are defined in an [[s-expr]] based file. A tile has an ID number a set of images (it's an animated tile if it has more than 1 image) and contains a set of attributes like solid, icy, anim-fps...

= Example =

An example of a simple solid tile looks like this:

  (tile
    (id 7)
    (images
      "tiles/snow/snow1.png"
    )
  )

An animated waterfall tile (animation played with 10 fps):

  (tile
    (id 175)
    (images
      "tiles/waterfall/trans1-1-1.png"
      "tiles/waterfall/trans1-1-2.png"
      "tiles/waterfall/trans1-1-3.png"
      "tiles/waterfall/trans1-1-4.png"
    )
    (water #t)
    (anim-fps 10)
  )

It's also possible to extract parts of bigger images to create tiles. This extracts the upper left edge of the foresttiles-1.png file:

  (tile
    (id 1000)
    (images
      (region "tiles/forest/foresttiles-1.png" 0 0 32 32)
    )
  )

= Adding new tiles =

You can simply add new tiles with your favourite text editor. However we also provide an easy to use editor to make this task easier (especially extracting regions of bigger images). You can find it in the ''tools/tilemanager'' directory. It's a mono/gtk# app so you have to have these 2 things installed and should invoke make in that directory then. It'll create ''tilemanager.exe'' which you can then start with mono like this:

  mono tilemanager.exe
