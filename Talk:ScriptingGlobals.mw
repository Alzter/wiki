debug_collrects

This function lets you see the collision rectangles around a game creature or other object. The rectangle appears as a shaded box over the object's graphic. To see this feature, from the in game console screen type "debug_collrects(true)". 

The main reference says (enable), where maybe it should say (true) instead?
