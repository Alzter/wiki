Looks like a rough, '''pencil-drawn''' sketch of a Badguy (like step 1 in pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/gimp/drawing/drawing2.jpg). 

Can '''transform''' into several other Badguys by having parts of him erased, then redrawn.

Possible transformations could be:
* Snowball <-> Spiky 
* Spiky <-> Jumpy 
* Snowball <-> Bouncing_Snowball

Maybe she could be part of a '''bonus level''' that features '''doodle tiles'''?
