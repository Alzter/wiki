I opt to fix the following issues (from the [[TODO]] list):

* '''H:''' reimplement fish
** Status: halted (may be taken over)
** Progress: ~80%
** ETA: Unknown

* '''H:''' describe scripting API
** Status: in progress
** Progress/ETA: n/a (anytime somebody adds a new wrapper function, I have to write a sentence about it)

In case you feel like taking over some of these tasks, tell me about that on the [[User_talk:RavuAlHemio/Tasks|discussion page]].

== Completed tasks ==
* '''L:''' rename GameObject::action() to GameObject::update() (this includes renaming active_action and inactive_action)
** Status: in repository
