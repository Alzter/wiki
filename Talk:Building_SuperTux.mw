==Building 'Tux: Some issues==

All of these issues are on MAC OS X 10.4, with the full set of developer tools installed.

•I CANNOT get PhysFS 1.0.1 to compile (although 1.1.0 compiles perfectly.)

•LibJpeg and libPNG are being recalcitrant as well. More details soon, although if someone has a generalized solution...

== Gentoo ==

It should be "emerge -avn subversion ftjam media-libs/openal physfs libsdl sdl-image libvorbis libogg". Page is locked so I cannot edit it myself.

== Debian ==

In Debian, there is a package for Supertux 0.3.3. Using the command "apt-get build-dep supertux", one can install the libraries supertux depends on, which are exactly the ones used in the svn version. Using this command is simpler than to know which libraries are to install, which are already there on the system, how to compile them and so on. Couldn't edit, the article is locked.
