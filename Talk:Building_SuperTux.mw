==Building 'Tux: Some issues==

All of these issues are on MAC OS X 10.4, with the full set of developer tools installed.

•I CANNOT get PhysFS 1.0.1 to compile (although 1.1.0 compiles perfectly.)

•LibJpeg and libPNG are being recalcitrant as well. More details soon, although if someone has a generalized solution...

== Gentoo ==

It should be "emerge -avn subversion ftjam media-libs/openal physfs libsdl sdl-image libvorbis libogg". Page is locked so I cannot edit it myself.
