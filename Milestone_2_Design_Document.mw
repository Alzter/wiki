For the last voice meeting see: [[SuperTux Meeting 18. August 2007]]

This document is meant to give a reasonably detailed guide on what shall and shall not happen in Milestone 2. It is also intended as a complete replacement of other, incomplete or otherwise flawed, Milestone 2 documents floating around in this Wiki. This design document is written by Grumbel, question and comments are welcome, use the Talk page or the IRC channel for that. At the moment this document is a work-in-progress, meaning goals might change as time progresses. This document as not yet been approved by any other member of the SuperTux development stuff.

__TOC__

= Overview = 

Doing a forest world turned out impractical with the current available and active man-power for that reason Milestone 2 got retargeted to a much smaller accomplishable goal.

= General =

* Tux run animation shall be rolled back to the single-sprite on that was used in Milestone 1, the current split-image animation is far inferior
* uni-solid tiles shall be provided for all tilesets
* multi-layer paralax scrolling background tilemaps shall be used in all levels
* menu system should be replaced/reworked
* save system could need a rework as well
* language shall be changeable via the option menu, LANG environment variable shall only be used as default setting
* worldmap Tux sprite should get animations for left, right, up, down directions, not just a single one as now

= Menu System =

Menu system of Milestone1 is rather ugly and could need a rewrite as well as a reorganization of some things:

* menu system needs support for scrolling, large lists of levels currently break it
* profiles should replace save slots (XBox-like)
* on Linux there is no real need for multiple profiles, only one should be used by default
* for each item there shall be a sub box displayed explaining it:

     +------------------------+
     |   Fullscreen        [] |
     |   Music Volume [ ####] |
     | * Aspect:         16/9 |
     +------------------------+
 +---------------------------------+
 | Adjust Monitor aspect ration... |
 +---------------------------------+

== Profile ==

* Create new profile
* Profile1 -> Main Menu
* Profile2 -> Main Menu
* ...

== Main Menu ==

* Story/Start Game -> worldmap
* Contrib Levels -> submenu
* Add Ons -> submenu
* Options -> submenu
* Credits -> Credit Screen
* Quit -> exit the game

== Options == 

* Language
* Fullscreen: yes/no
* Aspect Ratio: 16/9, 16/10, 5/4, 4/3
* Sound Volume: off/0-100
* Music Volume: off/0-100
* Setup Keyboard:
* Setup Joystick:
* Use Profiles: yes/no

== Contrib Levels ==

* Check for new stuff online
* complete contrib worlds
* browse folders with level stuff

= Controls =

Game Controls will be configurable, either the keyboard or a joystick can be used, additional support for more exotic devices such as Wiimotes might be present as well. The basic control scheme works by having a dpad (left, right, up, down) along with one or two action buttons, depending on the users configuration one action button will be used for jump and the other for grabbing object or jump will be bound to the up-direction and just one action button is needed for grabbing.

== Configuration 1 (jump with button) ==

* left/right/up/down: navigate worldmap and levels
* up: enter doors
* action1: jump, enter a level
* action2: grab

== Configuration 2 (jump with up) ==

* left/right/up/down: navigate worldmap and levels
* up: jump or enter doors
* action1: grab, enter a level

Additional buttons allow to pause the game, enter the menu and other meta-game functions.

= Actions =

== Jumping ==
FIXME: How high, how is it influenced by running?
<br clear="all" />

== Running ==
FIXME: How fast, how does it influence jump, how long is acceleration?

<br clear="all" />

== Backflip ==
The backflip is a special jump which gives Tux some extra height compared to a normal jump.
<br clear="all" />

== Butt Jump ==
[[Image:Supertux-buttjump.png|thumbnail|right|Butt Jump]]
The Butt Jump is activated by pressing down while in the air. It causes Tux to crush down on the exact spot over which he currently is. The butt jump provides additional force that allows him to crush blocks and some kind of armored enemies.
<br clear="all" />

= Game Elements =

== Icefloe ==

[[Image:Icefloe.png|thumbnail|right|Ice Floe]]

<br clear="all" />

== Reset Points ==

There shall be no reset points in the game, instead it should be made sure that levels are small enough to not require them. 

== No Lives ==

There will be no lives and no punishment for death aside from having to restart the level, due to the lack of reset points there simply is no need for lives.

= Levels = 

The levels of Milestone1 lack verticality as well as unisolid tiles, Milestone2 should fix that by adding those elements. Also the levels should be shortened/split to avoid the need for reset points. Another important point is that each level should try follow a clear design premise instead of being more or less random collection of tiles and enemies. The levels from Milestone1 should be taken as a point of inspiration and starting point, not as something that is verbatim copied over to Milestone2. 

The worldmap should be rolled back to that of Milestone1, i.e. a mostly linear map, but additional optional paths shall be added. 

== Cleanup ==

The test/ levels are currently quite a big mess, there needs to be clea nup to reduce them to those that are really needed otherwise its to easy to miss the ones that are important.

= Creatures =

== Starfish ==

Star shall get replaced by a starfish.

== Ice Fish == 

Already in the code, but not much used in Milestone1 Levels
<br clear="all" />

== Owl ==
[[Image:Owl.png|thumbnail|right|Owl]]
A flying enemy that can land on trees and carry things around to throw at Tux.
<br clear="all" />

== Angry Iceblock ==
[[Image:Angrystone.png|thumbnail|right|Angry Stone]]

Like Angry Stone, but with iceworld theme.
<br clear="all" />

== Canon ==
[[Image:Canon.png|thumbnail|right|Canon]]
The canon can be mounted on either static or rotatable pedestal. It shoots angry looking canonballs.

<br clear="all" />

== Mini Bomb ==
[[Image:Minibomb.png|thumbnail|right|Mini-Bomb]]
The Mini-Bomb is an small version of the normal bomb, it approaches in groups most of the time and is aggressive, it however is non-lethal to Tux and only works to either distract him and throw him back.
<br clear="all" />

== Spitter ==
[[Image:Spitter.png|thumbnail|right|Spitter]]
The spitter acts as walking dispenser, the enemy type that he can spit out might be limited to mini-bombs and similarly small enemies.
<br clear="all" />

== Yeti ==
[[Image:Yeti-concept.jpg|thumbnail|right|64px|Yeti]]
[[Image:Yetiapproach.png|thumbnail|left|Yeti Boss Cutscene]]

The Yeti is the boss that awaits Tux in the first castle. After entering the throne room Tux will find a letter in which Nolok tells Tux of the other castles in other worlds (see Milestone1 extro.txt). In the background there is a window. While reading the note one will see a shadow approaching the window and soon after the Yeti jumping through the window. The normal boss battle starts instantly after the jump.

The current Yeti pattern needs to be reworked, since it is to easy to just stand in a corner and do nothing.
<br clear="all" />

== Snowman ==
[[Image:Snowman-variations.png|thumbnail|right|Snowman]]

* a snowman enemy shall be added, a snowman is build out of a base body combined with a snowball head, if the body is destroyed, the snowman turns into a snowball

== Stay-On-Platform Snowball ==

* an additional type of snowballs shall be provided to signal stay-on-platform behaviour (a bandana or something like that)

== Crystallo ==

[[Image:Crystallo.png|thumbnail|right|Crystallo]]

???

== Eater ==
[[Image:Eater.png|thumbnail|right|Eater]]
The Eater is a very small enemy, half the size of a snowball, he can however expand a lot. If Tux gets to close to him the Eater will open his mouth wide enough that he can devour Tux or even other badguys. He his not defeatable by jumping onto him, since he will then just eat Tux. Throwing stuff at him won't work either, since again he will just eat them.
<br clear="all" />

= World 1 - Icyisland =

World 1, the icyisland, was released with Milestone 1, the intend of Milestone 2 is to adapt it to the new engine features as well as improving it by adding new enemies and new gameplay elements. While level structure might be recyclable in many places, it will often need structural improvements to provide real use of vertical and horizontal scrolling, instead of just locking the player in a horizontal-only scrolling level. Things that need to be done:
[[Image:Newpipe_blue.png|thumbnail|right|New Pipe Variations]]
* Jumpy shall be replaced with an enemy that fits better into the snow landscape, Jumpy himself shall be reused in a lava-like setting or in the bosses castle
* the walrus salesmen shall be added to the island
* some levels shall be separated out into optional paths, to provide a less linear path
* the old Milestone1 worldmap shall be used, not the one currently present in SVN
* iceblocks which will melt on contact with fire shall allow to lock paths in a level or lock secrets
* balanced platforms that start to rotate or move when Tux stands on them shall be provided
* water, in its simplistic tile form, shall be removed from all levels
* uni-solid/half-tiles shall be used to enhance the levels and provide optional paths
* bottom-less pits shall be either replaced by pits with spike at the bottom or allow Tux to climb back out of the pit

* there shall be auto-scrolling levels that force Tux to run by having a avalanche coming down behind him, the avalanche might either be simple snow or a large group of enemies
* the castle tileset shall be replaced with something that looks colder and features both snow and ice
* cave tileset shall be replaced with something that has a larger pattern, thus looks less ugly when tiled
* tiles picturing deadly spikes build out of ice shall be created

<br clear="all" />



= Intro/Credits =
[[Image:Introcutscene.png|thumbnail|left|Intro Storyboard]]
The text based intro and credits shall be replaced with cutscenes, showing the events that are described in the text. Instead of auto-scrolling text the game shall provide text that doesn't scroll, but instead only continues up on user interaction (i.e. press action button to see the next page of text). Text in cutscenes shall get printed letter by letter to the screen to provide a sense of 'motion'. Voice over from a story-teller might be consideration, while Tux, Penny and Nolok itself shall remain without speech.
<br clear="all"/>

= Task List =

* optimize the build process, building SuperTux currently takes ages
* change game back to use Milestone1 single-sprite SuperTux
* do a 32x32 top-down water animation for the worldmap
* Tux isn't centered properly to his collision box
* [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0400.pdf Cyrillic Font]
* seperate lisp reader, tinygettext and other libraries properly out of SuperTux
