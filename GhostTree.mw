* The tree is walking left/right, there will be platforms around the tree so tux can jump these to avoid getting hit
* The tree is growing roots from the ground to attack you
* The tree is glowing in a color that changes from time to time
* The tree is sucking in colored will-o-wisp like things that have the same color as himself
* Sucked in will-o-wisps make him grow
* You destroy the tree by throwing something in a different color at him (lamps or arcorns?)
