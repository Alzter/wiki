The camera blocker is a trigger-tile that prevents the camera from scrolling into a certain direction (i.e. the camera will stop scrolling if it would bring a camera blocker tile into sight). Also, it will instantly kill Tux on contact.
It will be used to create gaps in vertical-scrolling levels and to hide certain places from the player.
Of course, like all trigger tiles, this must be used with care!
