The '''buttjump''' is an ability that lets [[Tux]] crush boxes from above and destroy some [[badguy]]s that cannot be harmed by a normal jump. It is performed by jumping up into the air and then pressing the ''Down'' key while in the air. Take a look at the [[:Category:Buttjumpable badguys|buttjumpable badguys category]] for a list of badguys that can be harmed by a buttjump.

The buttjump has the following flow of actions

# Tux jumps up as normal
# Player presses 'down'
# Tux does some acrobatic movement to get into the 'butt-position'
# Tux then falls down back to the ground, butt first
# When smashing on the ground wooden boxes will be destroyed
# It takes Tux a small amount of time to jump back onto his feet to get back to normal

== Proposed action ==

=== Super-Butt-Jump ===

# Player moves Tux to a high position on the map
# Player jumps from the ledge
# Player presses 'down'
# Tux does some acrobatic movement to get into the 'butt-position'
# Tux then falls down back to the ground, butt first with increasing speed, due to the higher altitude he will change to Super-Butt-Jump-mode
# When smashing on the ground nearby enemies might be turned upside down, rendering them unmovable or killing them (might depend on the type of enemy and of the type of ground)
# It takes Tux a small amount of time to jump back onto his feet to get back to normal
