The butt-jump is an ability that would let [[Tux]] to jump up into the air and then come crashing down, breaking any blocks beneath him and killing any nearby enemies. Implementation would be as follows:


==Proposals==

===Proposal 1===

* Tux will get the basic ability to butt-jump after a completing a certain part of the game (for example, after the first world). The basic butt-jump has the ability to break wooden boxes (and maybe other special blocks) and can be used by big Tux for an unlimited amount of times.
* Tux can collect a powerup that enables the butt-jump to kill enemies walking on the ground close to Tux. This powerup may be combined with other items like fire/ice flowers (?) and is lost when Tux gets hit by an enemy (or when he collects another item).
* Another powerup (or two of the first one) give Tux the power to create a mighty earthquake with the butt-jump that kills every enemy on the screen. This can be done only one time; after that, the butt-jump will return to basic or single-powerup mode.

===Proposal 2===

* Tux will get the basic ability to butt-jump after a completing a certain part of the game (for example, after the first world). The basic butt-jump has the ability to break brick tiles and can be used by big Tux an unlimited amount of times.
* Tux can collect coins/kill badguys to increase a [[power meter]]. After this power meter is filled, it will give Tux the power to create a mighty earthquake with the butt-jump that kills every enemy on the screen. This can be done only one time; after that, the meter is empty and must be refilled.
* The meter can be shared with other powers such as the bullets
* Perhaps levels could have secret areas that are only opened up with a particular super-move (earthquake causes landslide, revealing cave, etc.)? There could be secret areas that can't be opened up unless you come back to them later with a new power.

===Proposal 3===

* Tux will get the basic ability to butt-jump lightly after a completing a certain part of the game (for example, after the first world). The basic butt-jump has the ability to break brick tiles and can be used by big Tux an unlimited amount of times.
* Tux can collect coins/kill badguys to increase a [[power meter]]. After this power meter is filled to a certain threshold, it will give Tux the ability to do a stronger butt-jump that kills nearby enemies, and each time he does, the meter will be decreased by a relatively small amount. When the meter reaches 0, Tux will go back to the basic butt-jump ability. Note that the threshold does not mean one strong butt-jump, but rather strong butt-jumps enabled (and each strong butt-jump will decrease the meter by a fraction of the threshold). If the meter is filled even more up to a second threshold, Tux will be able to create a mighty earthquake with the butt-jump that kills every enemy on the screen. This can be done only one time; after that, the meter is emptied and must be refilled.
* The meter can be shared with other powers such as the bullets (i.e. one bullet = one meter unit, one strong butt-jump = 1 meter unit, etc)
* Perhaps levels could have secret areas that are only opened up with a particular super-move (earthquake causes landslide, revealing cave, etc.)? There could be secret areas that can't be opened up unless you come back to them later with a new power.
