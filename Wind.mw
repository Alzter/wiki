{{Milestone 2}}[[Category:Game Object]]

Generally speaking, Wind is a region in a level that influences Tux' speed while he's not standing on solid ground. Wind can be scripted to create e.g. air gushes coming out of pipes or water streams that can be switched on and off. See [[ScriptingWind]] for a detailed description about how to manipulate a Wind object with Squirrel scripts.
