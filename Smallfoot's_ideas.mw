Here I present my ideas.

== Ice breaking ==
There are ice tiles or ice ground that can be walked on. They can also be jumped on without break. But if Tux does the "buttjump" then it breaks the tile/ground. Perhaps this can be used to reach other areas or enter secret places.

== Geiser ==
There can be geisers on levels. That blow up water. Tux can stand on this stream to reach high places which are too high for him to jump upon. Could also be wind or something.

== Teleporter ==
There are teleporters or some magic force fields that work as teleportation means on the level. When Tux walks on the teleporter he gets teleported to somewhere else.

== Diving ==
Tux can dive in water. Perhaps he need go up to surface to get more air sometimes (limited time underwater). Movement under water is slower than on land. Perhaps there are monsters under water such as sharks, pirayas, "the dopefish" and perhaps even some kind of boss.
Can be a underwater tunnel, world, level, cave or something. Maybe need pull a switch/lever under water or do something there to open something on the surface.

== Doors / Bridges ==
Tux needs to enter doors or open bridgets to pass to some place. In order todo that, he needs to todo something first. Such as get a key, or pull/push a lever or a switch. Or perhaps place an item (such as an stone or something) on a switch.

== Rollable/pushable stones ==
These stones can be pushable so they start rolling.
#Can be pushed to roll over enemies so they die.
#Can be pushed to places and then jumped upon to jump from the stone to reach higher places which are otherwise unreachable.
#Can be pushed onto a switch to trigger the switch to trigger something, such as opening/unlocking a door/bridge, etc.

== Pushable crates ==
Kind of similiar to the above mentioned "rollable/pushable stone". But these can only be pushed and not rolled. Can not harm enemies.
