Note: This idea was [[Rejected ideas|rejected]].

A system supplementing the current power-ups, this is basically a way to allow large and powerful effects without letting the player use them all the time. The meter could be increased by collecting coins, killing enemies, or getting points. When the meter is full the player can enter a specific control sequence (this is so the player can still use the power normally when the meter is full) to use a super-powerful attack, which would usually wipe out all the normal enemies onscreen and might have other effects as well (such as opening secret areas in the level).
