Hey! I'm jothesmo.

Around the wiki, I rewrite pages, reword things, correct errors, and add some suggestions.

I'm a very active level-creator for SuperTux, though I haven't submitted any. Together, me and my friend have made 24 levels, and it's growing! Some of them, however, are pretty short. I am currently in the process of making a level pack containing selected levels of mine.

Process: Creating read-me file. (40%)
