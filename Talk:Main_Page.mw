== Sandbox ==

Should I (or we) create a sandbox page so that it would deter people from making test edits on the &quot;normal&quot; pages? (Sorry this is here, but there is no general discussion page. Anyways, if this is a go-ahead, I will create a link from the main page.) --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 06:27, 4 Dec 2005 (CET)
*[[SuperTux:Sandbox|Sandbox]] created anyways, but will be protected for now. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 01:43, 12 Dec 2005 (CET)
