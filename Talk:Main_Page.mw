== Sandbox ==

Should I (or we) create a sandbox page so that it would deter people from making test edits on the "normal" pages? (Sorry this is here, but there is no general discussion page. Anyways, if this is a go-ahead, I will create a link from the main page.) --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 06:27, 4 Dec 2005 (CET)
