I cant accomplish the final level of the bonus island 2,
whenever I try to jump over the long abyss with the flying snowball in the middle, I fall down. I dont know how to jump to the next block.

can you help me

In the latest version if you hold down the UP_ARROW you will get an extra bounce which is more than enough to get to the next block. This has been discussed on the fansite -F50
