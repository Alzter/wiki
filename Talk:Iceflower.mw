I think ice bullets should freeze ice badguys as well, adding size and 2-6 hp and either slowing them down or stopping them completely. Also i think ice bullets are too powerful, they are almost more desireable in every way to fire bullets. They do not bounce, so they hit *every* badguy in their path, they also can cross vast expanses. They do not cause forest fires. Fire bullet gets bad effects from mudball, possibly tumbleweed, and probably walkingtotems and any tree badguys. -F50
:The fire bullets are to weak by themselves, even in Super Mario most of the other items beat it. 

==Platforms=
I think it could be cool if the frost enemies could serve as platforms, so they dont get destroyed if you jump above them and be useful to get to higher places. If you want to make them destroyable they could be by butt jumping, for example. --[[User:80.174.65.16|80.174.65.16]] 21:30, 11 Aug 2006 (BST)
