I think ice bullets should freeze ice badguys as well, adding size and 2-6 hp and either slowing them down or stopping them completely. Also i think ice bullets are too powerful, they are almost more desireable in every way to fire bullets. They do not bounce, so they hit *every* badguy in their path, they also can cross vast expanses. They do not cause forest fires. Fire bullet gets bad effects from mudball, possibly tumbleweed, and probably walkingtotems and any tree badguys.
