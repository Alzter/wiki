star treck guy gets captured!

ducky and star treck guy were out having a nice<br />
penguin sandwich on the ice fields of raccoon city.<br />
Suddenly, a golum jumped from<br />
behind a bush, there was a flash,<br />
and ducky died......im just kidding:)!<br />

When Ducky wakes up, he finds that Star treck guy<br />
is missing. Where he lay before now<br />
lies a letter with a stain of anthony brain. "Ducky, my arch enemy!"<br />
says the letter. "I have captured<br />
your toatly ugly husband star treck guy and have taken him<br />
to my fortress. The path to my fortress<br />
is littered with my mini boobie bots. Give up on<br />
the thought of trying to reclaim him,<br />
you haven't a chance! Love Golum"<br />

Ducky looks and sees Golums's fortress in<br />
the distance. Wow his fortress is like a four<br />
minute drive from here this guy has the worst hiding places GOSH!<br />

== Part II ==

As Tux runs from the Yeti monster, he sees a ship. The monster is gaining, and the ship is leaving. Tux only has one chance... he gets on his belly and slides as fast as he can. Tux gets massive "Air Time" as he flies off the iceberg, Yeti in persuit. He screames "I'm coming, Penny!" as he lands on the ship with his belly. As he turns around, he sees the Yeti tumbling down in to the ocean...

== Proposed story for future worlds ==

This section is just some brainstorming ideas for future worlds that may or may not exist.

=== Tropical Island ===

Tux goes to a tropical island after the forest keep. He goes through many levels and finds Nolok's base camp, which is by a port leading to world 4. There, Tux finds a giant snake which he fights.

=== Ocean ===
Tux finds the Helicopter that Nolok took Penny in but there is no one there. So, Tux heads off to find Nolok's Hideout, Tux looks around and sees nothing but 16 metal\concrete platforms. Tux finds out that he must pull a lever on each of these to raise (uncover?) Nolok's Hidden fortress.

=== Grassland ===
After Nolok flees with Penny out of his ocean hideaway, he ends up in a vast Grassland area. It seems to be easier than the previous two worlds as Tux can see the castle in the distance, but when he gets there he finds a number of doors each containing many hazards. He must enter each one to press some (ropes/levers/buttons) to bridge some huge "security" gaps in Nolok's main room. Again, Tux just misses Penny, but finds a new note from her telling him something that will aid him in the next world.
