Penny gets captured!

Tux and Penny were out having a nice<br>
picnic on the ice fields of Antarctica.<br>
Suddenly, a creature jumped from<br>
behind an ice bush, there was a flash,<br>
and Tux fell asleep!<br>

When Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny<br>
is missing. Where she lay before now<br>
lies a letter. "Tux, my arch enemy!"<br>
says the letter. "I have captured<br>
your beautiful Penny and have taken her<br>
to my fortress. The path to my fortress<br>
is littered with my minions. Give up on<br>
the thought of trying to reclaim her,<br>
you haven't a chance! -Nolok"<br>

Tux looks and see Nolok's fortress in<br>
the distance. Determined to save his<br>
beloved Penny, he begins his journey.<br>

== Proposed story for future worlds ==

This section is just some brainstorming ideas for future worlds that may or may not exist.

=== Ocean ===
Tux finds the Helicopter that Nolok took Penny in but there was no one there. So Tux heads off to find Noloks Hideout, Tux looks around and seen nothing but 16 metal\concrete platforms. Tux finds out that he must pull a lever on each of these to raise Noloks Hidden fotress.

=== Grassland ===
After Nolok flees with Penny out of his ocean hideaway Tux ends up in the vast Grassland area. It seems to be easier than the previous two worlds as Tux can see the castle in the distance, but when he gets there he finds a number of doors each containing many hazards. He must enter each one too press some (ropes/levers/buttons) to bridge some huge "security" gaps in Noloks main room. Again Tux just misses penny, but finds a new note from her telling him something (that helps in in next world.)
