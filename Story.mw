Penny gets captured

Tux and Penny were out having a nice<br>
picnic on the ice fields of Antarctica.<br>
Suddenly, a creature jumped from<br>
behind an ice bush, there was a flash,<br>
and Tux fell asleep!<br>

When Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny<br>
is missing. Where she lay before now<br>
lies a letter. "Tux, my arch enemy!"<br>
says the letter. "I have captured<br>
your beautiful Penny and have taken her<br>
to my fortress. The path to my fortress<br>
is littered with my minions. Give up on<br>
the thought of trying to reclaim her,<br>
you haven't a chance! -Nolok"<br>

Tux looks and see Nolok's fortress in<br>
the distance. Determined to save his<br>
beloved Penny, he begins his journey.<br>
