== '''Hi''' ==
I'm a Supertux fan. Why would anyone who wasn't have a Tux Wiki account?
Unless they're putting TRASH on here for fun.
... what I'd like to know is why you've come to my user page. 
Maybe you did it by mistake or something like that.
Whatever the reason, I'd like to tell you some of my ideas, if you'd care to read them.


So, here are my ideas:

== Badguys: ==

=== Papaya: ===

A papaya with eyes and feet.
Since this a very tropical fruit, I though it would do well as an badguy for Tropical Islands.
However, other tropical fruits are certainly an option, and, of course,
the badguy needn't even ''be'' a fruit.
Mangoes and bananas would also work fine.

=== [[Nutty]]: ===

Nutty is a coconut. He has a palm leaf for hair and walks around.
He is similar to Mr IceBlock and Slow Snail. When jumped,
he loses his feet and eyes and can be kicked or carried.

=== [[Mr Palm Tree]]: ===

Similar to Walking Totem. A stack of segments,
with the topmost being egg-shaped and having leaves.
When jumped upon, the bottom segment is squished. 
The entire tree drops down and the next segment sprouts feet and resumes walking.
The tree does not walk off any edges and turns around if any segment touches a block.
It is squishable, butt-jumpable, burnable and freezable.
It throws out coconuts from the bases of the leaves which hit the ground,
bounce a few times and then turn into [[Nutty]].
While in the air and while bouncing they are burnable,
but not squishable, butt-jumpable or freezable.

=== [[Ghostly Tree]]: ===

This one is for the Ghost forest.
Although, as you'll see if you follow the link, this idea had already been thought of,
I did think of it myself before seeing that, and I originally called it Spooky Tree.
It is similar to the normal Mr Tree, but instead of two Ivies it releases two [[bat]]s.
I also though that Spooky Tree (or even Mr Tree) could have two branches either side of him 
which Tux could stand on.

=== [[Bat]]: ===

I had him called Mr Bat, and discovered as I did with Spooky Tree 
that someone already had a similar idea.
However, my Mr Bat is released from Spooky Trees and this is his pattern of behaviour:

The two Mr Bats fly up to the top of the screen at a slight angle away from Spooky Tree, 
one on either side.
Then both bats fly straight at Tux, who must dodge at the right moment.
If he dodges to soon, they will swerve, if he dodges to late, they'll get him.
If he dodges at the right time, the bats are stunned, at which point they could be squished.
If they weren't squished soon enough, they would fly
again to the top of the screen and again at Tux, and so on, and so on...

=== [[Anteater]] ===

I also provided a concept sketch for the anteater, as well as a few ideas about behaviour. 
(The head not hurting Tux and the swishy tail.)

=== Avalanche ===

I read in the meeting log for August '07 the idea for an avalanche that chases Tux along,
as opposed to an auto-scrolling screen.
I like this idea, and here's a few ideas of my own:
*The types of badguys could vary: eg, Snowballs in Icyisland. However, although Ivies are the Snowball equivalents in
Forest Island (which insidentally should have a more catchy name like Icyisland) they aren't really round enough to 
form an avalanche. So perhaps a pile of mossy rocks? Coconuts in the tropical islands?

== Worlds and Tilesets ==

=== Tilesets for Tropical Islands (World 3) ===

==== The Beach ====

Sand dunes with tufts of grass. Levels on the edges of the island could be like this.

==== The Palm Forest ====

A rocky ground with mossy rocks and ferns and palm trees (similar to trees in world 2 but palms). Perhaps trees could have coconuts in them, some of which drop? Tufts of grass.

==== The Volcano ====

Tropical islands always have volcanoes on them, it's a known fact. So there could be rocky grey tiles with lots of lava in the levels and different badguys (Lots of Pyros and Flames).
