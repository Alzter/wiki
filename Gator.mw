I think there should be floating logs in the Forest world, which move around when Tux jumps on them.

Some might actually be Gator-like creatures and get Tux.

Behaviour: lays like a log until Tux jumps on it, then gets him.

Look: An Alligator

Hurt Tux: Tries to eat him when jumped on

Hurt it: use Spitting, will try to get Tux when attacked
