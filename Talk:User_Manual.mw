== Dying??? ==
Help!! i have the 0.3.1 version and i lose like 300 coin whenever i die. is there anything i can do?
: If you really lose exactly 300 coins, this is a bug in SuperTux that needs to be fixed. To track down the error, please try to reproduce the error and post the exact steps someone else would need to make to see the error, too. If, on the other hand, you lose exactly 25 coins, this is intended and the mechanism documented in both the User Manual and in-game. --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 01:07, 24 December 2007 (UTC)
