Hi all! 
You are The Best!!! 
G'night


== Improved Danger ==

I'd like a list off all the bad guys containing their unique abilities and how they are killed.

A list of the unmoving dangers such as the strange flowers in the forest would also be helpful.

I'd write it myself if I just knew enough about them. In milestone 2 there are new ways to jump that will kill bad guys that aren't killed by regular jumps. Which these are would be very helpful to know.

:What is this about a special way to jump that kills bad guys? Did I miss something in the svn log or is that just a whishlist item? --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 21:58, 21 June 2007 (UTC)

::I never tried it, but...
''"Butt Stomp (Milestone 2 only)

Only Big Tux has this ability. When in the air, press the Duck key to perform a Butt Stomp. Tux can use it to break wooden crates from above and '''defeat certain badguys that are not harmed by a normal jump.'''"''
