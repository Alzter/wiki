Hi all! 
You are The Best!!!

== Improved Danger ==

I'd like a list off all the bad guys containing their unique abilities and how they are killed.

A list of the unmoving dangers such as the strange flowers in the forest would also be helpful.

I'd write it myself if I just knew enough about them. In milestone 2 there are new ways to jump that will kill bad guys that aren't killed by regular jumps. Which these are would be very helpful to know.
