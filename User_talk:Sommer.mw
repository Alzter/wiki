Please tell me where that Teleporter is one SuperTux 0.3.0 or Milestone 1.9! I can't find it and I can't get to the level on the small island in the top right hand corner of the map for World 2! I have had so much frustration!
*Which one are you talking about? The only island with a bonus level on it is in Icy Island, and you access it by pressing 'enter' from the dead-end.
:...though I ''did'' hear something about a second bonus level being accessible from near "Three Sheets to the Wind"... [[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 23:16, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
