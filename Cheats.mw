For these cheats to work you have to be in debug mode.
(To get into debug mode ctrl-click SuperTux.app, open contents, open MacOS; open a terminal window, drag SuperTup to the terminal window, type "--debug-mode" and hit enter.)
Do not type these in, you just press the appropriate key, eg the Tab key.

    * end - gain 50 coins
    * tab - become bigtux
    * delete - become firetux
    * l - take away a life
    * insert - become invincible (stars)-[on some keyboards this is the HELP key]
    * tab - become smalltux 



To get in debug mode on other *nix's start the game with: supertux --debug-mode
