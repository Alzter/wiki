I like SuperTux.

I have created 2 levelsets:

*www.freewebs.com/simon_eriksson/erikssonsplace1dot10.zip Erikssons place
*www.freewebs.com/simon_eriksson/chaotic1dot0.zip Penny and Tux:Chaotic

I have sent both levelsets to the inofficial fansite, but they aren't able to download yet.

I am very active on swedish wikipedia. (sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Super-Simon)
