Greetings, I am LMH.  Since I was five-years-old and got my hands on my first NES I've had an interest in designing my own levels for 2D side-scrollers.  Back then it was magic marker on discarded continuous feed paper for recently out-dated dot matrix printers.  Later I deciphered the format of level files for a Mario clone on my TI-89 calculator, which kept me entertained in my less interesting high school lectures (unfortunately those levels are likely lost to time).  When I discovered SuperTux, I was made immediately nostalgic for the simple yet entertaining gaming style of my youth.  When I found out there was an editor, I just had to make my own levels.  I couldn't get the editor working at first, but that's nothing a sophisticated system of spreadsheets can't fix.  As I made more levels, I learned more about how SuperTux works and am now able to make modest contributions to the project.  Below are some of the projects I'm currently working on.

==Add-ons for 0.3.3-GIT==

I intend to devote a consistent effort in maintaining the [[Add-ons]] downloadable through the in-game add-on manager (now stored on [https://code.google.com/p/supertux/source/list?repo=addons google code]).  This is the natural evolution of the add-on collection I maintained while the in-game list was difficult to change.  That collection still exists [http://www.mediafire.com/?k47v61nz6i230 here], which serves as an archive for older versions of SuperTux.  I will also try to maintain one add-on to rule them all, that is all add-ons combined in one for easy activation.  This will need to be manually installed since it is a very large file and I do not think it is appropriate to lag up the game with its download through the in-game add-on manager.



==Mattie's World==

Mattie's World is the collection of all the levels I've developed.  It will be a work in progress so long as I'm making levels.  Although designing levels is my primary interest, it should be fairly evident that I'm easily distracted.  My current plan is to have three worldmaps.

===Mattie's Iceberg===

The original set of levels made for SuperTux and available as an in-game [[add-on]], Mattie's Iceberg is the first worldmap ([http://supertux.lethargik.org/addons/files/mattie_world.zip lives here]).  Although it has changed considerably over the years, it is likely in it's final state and was made for the SVN version of SuperTux (requiring only compatibility tweaks as SuperTux is further developed).  Set near Antarctica, levels are primarily ice-themed.  The story is that the iceberg has been overrun by the minions of the DOOM Toad who resides in the end castle.

===DOOM Islands===

The rest of the ice-themed levels that I make are expected to live in the worldmap DOOM Islands which is currently under construction ([http://www.mediafire.com/?3l36un8vj7wobly beta here]).  These frozen islands are to the north of Antarctica, and the stronghold of the DOOM Toad.  There will be more flexibility in path for this worldmap, and my intention is to have a second optional storyline culminating with a unique boss fight.  The main idea is to take out the Toad on his home turf.  Ideally these levels will be optimized for Milestone II.

===Peninsula Inland===

The final worldmap is meant to be a for forest levels and is only in the concept phase.  The general idea is that Tux reaches a peninsula where the DOOM Toad had a new and powerful ally.  There is no ETA on this portion of the project.

==Glow Effects==

One of the most interesting mechanics in SuperTux (for me) is the use of light (ambient, candles, magic blocks, and lanterns).  However they are not often utilized or are easily made obnoxious.  In an effort to make lighting a little cleaner and more enjoyable I've begun some coding work to add more built-in lighting effects.  The progress can be tracked in the "glow_effects" branch of [http://code.google.com/r/lmh0013-clone/source/list?name=glow_effects my SuperTux clone in Google Code].  My ideas for this project are listed below:

* (DONE) More ability for candles: choose color, option to disable flicker and glare, allows for better integration of custom sprites and environmental glow
* (IN-PROGRESS) Optional candle graphic sprites:  animated background torches, glowing crystals, maybe a brazier/open flame, maybe a light bulb
* (DONE) Powerups glow-in-the-dark: standard powerups (excepting 1ups) are easily located in dark areas and look cool in dim areas
* (DONE) Fireballs glow: they are fire after all, this always bothered me about the current configuration
* (DONE) Explosions light up immediate area: another obvious improvement 
* Weakblocks burn: probably should make burning weakblocks give off light as well
* (DONE) Some badguys glow: flame, willowisp, kugelblitz (also make flames vulnerable to ice and add a couple of flame-like badguys with other vulnerabilities/appearances)
* New badguy, dark_snowball: a dark themed badguy for the icy tileset, would be invincible while in the dark and vulnerable/stationary in the light.  Gives off a sinister glow.
* Possible new badguy, walking flame: like spiky, but can be "extinguished" using iceflower.  Would obviously also glow.
* (DONE) Tux glows when invincible: might be a nice addition
* Possible new powerup, earth flower: would give Tux a mining hat and subsequent light directly in front.  Would also have the ability to turn to stone momentarily similar to the Tanooki Suit of Mario 3
