Greetings, I am LMH.  Since I was five-years-old and got my hands on my first NES I've had an interest in designing my own levels for 2D side-scrollers.  Back then it was magic marker on discarded continuous feed paper for recently out-dated dot matrix printers.  Later I deciphered the format of level files for a Mario clone on my TI-89 calculator, which kept me entertained in my less interesting high school lectures (unfortunately those levels are likely lost to time).  When I discovered SuperTux, I was made immediately nostalgic for the simple yet entertaining gaming style of my youth.  When I found out there was an editor, I just had to make my own levels.  I couldn't get the editor working at first, but that's nothing a sophisticated system of spreadsheets can't fix.  As I made more levels, I learned more about how SuperTux works and am now able to make modest contributions to the project.  Below are some of the projects I'm currently working on.

==Add-ons for 0.3.3-GIT==

I intend to devote a consistent effort in maintaining the [[Add-ons]] downloadable through the in-game add-on manager (now stored on [https://code.google.com/p/supertux/source/list?repo=addons google code]).  This is the natural evolution of the add-on collection I maintained while the in-game list was difficult to change.  That collection still exists [http://www.mediafire.com/?k47v61nz6i230 here], which serves as an archive for older versions of SuperTux.  I will also try to maintain one add-on to rule them all, that is all add-ons combined in one for easy activation.  This will need to be manually installed since it is a very large file and I do not think it is appropriate to lag up the game with its download through the in-game add-on manager.

==LMH's Development TODO List==

I've decided to keep a list of all the things I'd like to do (or seen done) in SuperTux.  Instead of randomly throwing these into one of the many existing TODO lists, I've instead elected to keep my personal agenda here to emphasize that these are my own thoughts of what the game could use or needs (thus highly likely to be incomplete or outright inaccurate).  There is no particular order to this list.  Aside from some of the coding and just about all of the sound, these are all things within my ability.  Nevertheless help is more than welcomed :)

===Coding and Bug Fixes===
* Screen resolution/full screen toggle graphics issues
* Tux jitter when running up a slope and into a wall
* Timer to cancel backflip (currently an upward wind against a wall can cause Tux to be stuck)
* Camera reset after unpause (try peeking and then pausing)
* Dependent add-ons?  might be useful for custom tilesets
* Reset worldmap with ability to preserve stats or not
* Work on ungrab behavior for bomb (should be able to be tossed)
* Standardize grab/ungrab by moving behavior from rock to portable?
* Release images so the terminal doesn't fill up on close
* Multiple tilemapping support?  by sector or tilemap instead of level
* Loading/downloading messages for processes that can lag
* The firefly reactivation issue
* Instead of a coin penalty, reset powerups/coins on "Abort Level"
* Ability to download updates for languages
* Translatable script messages
* Sprite replacement ability e.g. Tux -> Penny/Penny -> Tux for "Play as Penny" (also available to add-ons)
* Swimming like a forced climbing (but fast- Tux is a penguin)? Think frog suit but controllable
* Optional ability to respawn unstable tile after a set duration
* Slope behavior needs improvement, perhaps allow Tux to slide
* Check on some of the draw layers for objects
:For example should draw weak_blocks on top of other objects such as coins
:Also killed badguys fall in front of bonus_blocks but behind bricks (or vice-versa)

===Sounds/Music===
* A fire-ice interaction, probably hissing like dropping a lit match into a glass of water
* Coin sound(s) that differ from coin collected sound (for coin rain/coin explode)
* Icecrusher landing
* ShortFuse pop
* Freeze/unfreeze?
* Tweak some of the voc music repetition
* Bounce on enemy sound
* Splash in water?

===Graphics===
* Replace backflip sprites with actual rotation
* Frozen enemies
* Better fish
* Better (animated) explosion
* A finished owl
:Can owl drop bombs? have to check, could then make skydive splat
* Consolidate/cleanup/organize image files and tilesets
* Find a way to make the menu border work
* A waterfall to match the new water look
* Fix tiling of crystal cave tiles
* Fill out some of the new tilesets (darksnow/blue mtn./etc.)
* Separate out some tilesets (ice/forest/castle/etc.)
* Re-work the backflip billboard since "jump with up" may not be in use
* Slick ice tiles that are useable (maybe as a semi-transparent overlay)
* Some of the newer snow/ice tiles are slightly discolored- fit it
* Animate some badguy deaths

===Regular Level Design===
* (IN-PROGRESS) Put together levels that introduce new game components for Icy Island
:Current iteration: platforms, multi-block, weak_block, blue mnt. tiles, short_fuse, climbing
* (IN-PROGRESS) Incorporate new components into existing levels
:Current iteration: levels prior to cave
* Work on Incubator Island -> Icy Island
* (IN-PROGRESS) Add parallax backgrounds to Icy Island levels
* A shop to spend coins

===Statistics Improvements===
* Allow partial stats when respawning at a checkpoint- should stop people from thinking that no stats on he worldmap is a bug
* New worldmap sprite for a level with stats at 100% (maybe including an option to have a target time as well)
* Fix the badguy counting bug with dispensers... ugh
* Check on worldmap stats text drawing at different resolutions

===Editor===
Where to begin...  let's just say that the editor needs lots of work from it's current state.

===Documentation and Distribution===
* Guide to GIT
* Update/consolodate TODO lists
* Remove/replace SVN wiki references
* Building references should be revisited
:I need to muster the courage to build in Windows, and document it
* Get CPack working to make distributable binaries - so close...
* Would a ST virtual machine be worthwhile? it would avoid Windows building falderal

===Badguy Ideas===
* Moving eyes for icecrusher as well as throw up some particles when it hits the ground
* Bouncing snowball without horizontal motion
* A sticky snowball that walks on walls/ceilings
* Another boss fight- A giant worm that bores through the ground 
* Play with a fire proof crystallo
* Maybe an ice proof spiky and invulnerably spiky
* Highly customizable mini-boss that can utilize different behaviors/sprites/vulnerabilities
* Someone's gotta throw things at Tux

===Powerup Ideas===
* BonusBlock drops powerups on butt-jump
* A BonusBlock that explodes like a bomb
* Generalized BonusBlock that can dispense badguys/objects
* Make iceflower more functional- pickup/stand on frozen enemies, unfreeze timer, update vulnerabilities, have a default frozen graphic, indication that unfreeze is about to happen
* Airflower that allows Tux to jump a little higher and a little farther
* Pau Pumpkin (pau is Hawaiian for done, pronounced "pow") like a pow block from Mario that kills everything on screen
* Some sort of temporary speed boost
* Alchemy potion that changes coins to a solid lead block and vice-versa

===Glow Effects===

In an effort to make lighting effects in SuperTux a little more enjoyable I've begun some coding work to add more built-in lighting effects.  The progress can be tracked in the "glow_effects" branch of [http://code.google.com/r/lmh0013-clone/source/list?name=glow_effects my SuperTux clone in Google Code].  My ideas for this project are listed below:

* (DONE) More ability for candles: choose color, option to disable flicker and glare, allows for better integration of custom sprites and environmental glow
* (IN-PROGRESS) Optional candle graphic sprites:  animated background torches, glowing crystals, maybe a brazier/open flame, maybe a light bulb
* (DONE) Powerups glow-in-the-dark: standard powerups (excepting 1ups) are easily located in dark areas and look cool in dim areas
* (DONE) Fireballs glow: they are fire after all, this always bothered me about the current configuration
* (DONE) Explosions light up immediate area: another obvious improvement 
* Weakblocks burn: probably should make burning weakblocks give off light as well
* (DONE) Some badguys glow: flame, willowisp, kugelblitz (also make flames vulnerable to ice and add a couple of flame-like badguys with other vulnerabilities/appearances)
* New badguy, dark_snowball: a dark themed badguy for the icy tileset, would be invincible while in the dark and vulnerable/stationary in the light.  Gives off a sinister glow.
* (IN-PROGRESS) Possible new badguy, walking flame: like spiky, but can be "extinguished" using iceflower.  Would obviously also glow.
* (DONE) Tux glows when invincible: might be a nice addition
* Possible new powerup, earth flower: would give Tux a mining hat and subsequent light directly in front.  Would also have the ability to turn to stone momentarily similar to the Tanooki Suit of Mario 3
* Three levels for alternate cave path on Icy Island that shows everything off

==Mattie's World==

Mattie's World is the collection of all the levels I've developed.  It will be a work in progress so long as I'm making levels.  Although designing levels is my primary interest, it should be fairly evident that I'm easily distracted.  My current plan is to have three worldmaps.

===Mattie's Iceberg===

The original set of levels made for SuperTux and available as an in-game [[add-on]], Mattie's Iceberg is the first worldmap.  Although it has changed considerably over the years, it is likely in it's final state and was made for the SVN version of SuperTux (requiring only compatibility tweaks as SuperTux is further developed).  Set near Antarctica, levels are primarily ice-themed.  The story is that the iceberg has been overrun by the minions of the DOOM Toad who resides in the end castle.

===DOOM Islands===

The rest of the ice-themed levels that I make are expected to live in the worldmap DOOM Islands which is currently under construction.  These frozen islands are to the north of Antarctica, and the stronghold of the DOOM Toad.  There will be more flexibility in path for this worldmap, and my intention is to have a second optional storyline culminating with a unique boss fight.  The main idea is to take out the Toad on his home turf.  Ideally these levels will be optimized for Milestone II.

===Peninsula Inland===

The final worldmap is meant to be a for forest levels and is only in the concept phase.  The general idea is that Tux reaches a peninsula where the DOOM Toad had a new and powerful ally.  There is no ETA on this portion of the project.
