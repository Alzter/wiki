'''SuperTux Portable''' aims to allow users to play SuperTux on embedded devices such as PDAs, the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or low-CPU PCs. This page is meant to collect ideas for a possible 'low spec SuperTux'.

== Implementation ==

The development should start on the GBA, since that is the device with the lowest, but still quite usable specs. The tiles in the game would be 16x16, so large Tux would be 32x16 large, half the size it was in Milestone1. Due to the tile and screen size, the visible on screen area would be equivalent to a 480x320 window in Milestone1, ie. smaller then that in Milestone1, but normal for GBA games.

== General Ideas For Decreasing Memory/CPU Requirements ==

* Lower resolution
* Disable sound, or use midi
* Optimize for hardware
