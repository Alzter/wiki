'''SuperTux Portable''' aims to allow users to play SuperTux on embedded devices such as PDAs, the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or low-CPU PCs. 

This page is meant to collect links to whatever ports are sitting around the internet. Note that the developers have nothing to do with these ports, so you're on your own when installing them or dealing with whatever problems they have.
