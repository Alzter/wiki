This page is meant to collect ideas for a possible 'low spec SuperTux', by that we mean a SuperTux branch for embedded devices like PDA, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS or low-CPU PCs.

== Devices ==

=== Mobile Phones ===

* Resolution: ???
* Controlls: 0-9 keypad, probally additional button to go into the menu
* Programming Language: Java
* Notes: due to limited controls and Java requirement this might need an extra version

=== Gameboy Advance ===

* Resolution: 240x160
* Graphics: Mode0 provides 4 tilemap layers and 128 sprites, tiles are 8x8 and you can have either 256 colors per tile and 256 tiles or 16 colors per tile and 512 tiles on a map
* Controls: DPad, A, B, Start, Select, L, R
* Programming Language: C, Assembler

=== Nintendo DS ===

* Resolution: 256x192
* Graphics: ???
* Controls: DPad, A, B, X, Y, Start, Select, L, R, Touchscreen
* Programming Language: C, Assembler

=== GP32x ===

* Resolution: 320x240
* Graphics: plain framebuffer
* Controls: DPad, A, B, Start, Select, L, R
* Programming Language: C, Assembler

=== GPx2 ===

* Resolution: 320x240
* Graphics: plain framebuffer, has SDL available
* Controls: DPad, A, B, X, Y, Start, Select, L, R
* Programming Language: C

=== Playstation Portable ===

* Resolution: 480 x 272
* Graphics: ???
* Controls: DPad, A, B, X, Y, Start, Select, L, R, Analog-Stick, (Analog-Button?)
* Programming Language: C, Assembler
* Notes: Resolution is to small for double-sprite size, yet to large for 32x16 sprites, maybe need something inbetween

=== PDA, Zaurus ===

* Resolution: 640x480
* Graphics: (Framebuffer?)
* Controls: Touchscreen, four-way dpad, (one button?)
* Programming Language: (C?)

=== PC ===

* Speed: game should be able to run on a Pentium 90Mhz CPU
* Resolution: 320x240, possible an additional 'scaled mode' with 640x480 for double sprite and tile size
* Controls: Gamepad with unknown number of buttons, at least 2 or Keyboard

== Implementation ==

The development should start on the GBA, since that is the device with the lowest, but still quite usable specs. The tiles in the game would be 16x16, so large Tux would be 32x16 large, half the size it was in Milestone1. Due to the tile and screen size, the visible on screen area would be equivalent to a 480x320 window in Milestone1, ie. smaller then that in Milestone1, but normal for GBA games.
