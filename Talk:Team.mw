Are the people on this the whole team? Looking at the mailing list, there are just too many anonymous people. Is this page a way to distinguish the clowns from real developers? How can you tell if "L", "Jabba TheHutt", "Mathnerd314" or "GG" is to be taken serious if they don't even dare to sign with a real name? On the other hand I don't want to piss of any developer, so sorry if one of the guys I used as example really is important. Nice to have some connection between IRC, the mailing list, bugtracker, SVN, forum and the wiki for developers as well as for fans.
