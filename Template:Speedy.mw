 '''Usage:''' <nowiki>{{speedy|reason}}</nowiki>

This page puts a bold red warning at the top of the page and adds the page to the [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]].

It should be added as the very first line on pages that are obvious candidates for deletion (e.g. vandalism, test pages, etc.) and whose deletion would be uncontentious.  For all other cases use <nowiki>{{delete|reason}}</nowiki>.

== Example ==
</noinclude>
<div style="background-color:#ffffff; padding: 0.5em; border:5px solid #c51919;">
<span style="color: #c51919;">'''This page or image is a candidate for speedy deletion.'''</span> The given reason is:  '''''{{{1|No reason supplied!}}}'''''

If you disagree with its '''speedy''' deletion, please edit the page and change <nowiki>{{speedy|reason}} to {{delete|reason}}</nowiki> and discuss your reasons on this page (or it's associated talk page, as applicable).

If this page obviously does not meet the common criteria for speedy deletion, or you intend to fix it, please remove this notice, but do not remove this notice from articles that you have created yourself.

Remember to check [[Special:Whatlinkshere/{{NAMESPACE}}:{{PAGENAME}}|if anything links here]] and [{{SERVER}}{{localurl:{{NAMESPACE}}:{{PAGENAME}}|action=history}} the page history] before deleting.
