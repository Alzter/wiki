==Generic==

===How do I move around in a level?===
Click and drag with the middle mouse button.


==Tiles==

===How do I add tiles to a level===
Click on the layer you want the tiles on and select the tile you want from the Tiles Tool.

===How do I filter the the tiles so I can find a specific one?===
With the Tiles tool selected, there is a combo box above the pane with all of the tiles in it.  This combo box contains categories which filter what is displayed in the pane.

===How should I place the tiles for the end-level structures?===
The best way to learn this is to look at existing levels. For the exit tree in MS2 the best place to look at is levels/test/tree-exit.stl at this point.

===How should I place floor and earth tiles to be the most aesthetically pleasing?===


==Objects==

===How do I easily align an object to the grid?===
Press the Control key while moving an object to snap to every 16 pixels.  Press the Shift key to snap to every 32 pixels.


==Other tools==

===How do I use brushes?===
Brushes are used to clean up edge tiles. There are a few brushes in trunk/supertux-sharp/data/brushes <!-- TODO: change this to a more "useful" path. -->. Load one in the level and then drag it over tiles to correct edge tiles of rough tile "blocks". Diffrent brushes are made for correcting diffrent tiles. 

Note that the brushes are incomplete so you might need to fix some things manually.

To create a new brush you got to "train" one:
#Make a level that looks good.
#Select the tilemap you placed those tiles in.
#Load the brush trunk/supertux-sharp/data/brushes/empty.csv <!-- TODO: change this to a more "useful" path. -->
#Right click and drag to select the area to get tiles from.
#*If you do that several times you wont owerwrite the currect patterns but instead add to them.
#*The minimum size for a selection that works is 3x3 tiles. 
#When you are finished save the brush.

Note that a good brush would need several thousand patterns.


==Sectors==

===How do I resize a sector?===
Right click on the [[#Where are the sector tabs?|tab for the sector]] and select "Resize".

===Where are the sector tabs?===
Near the top of the editor. The default sector in a level is called "main" and is the sector where the game will start.

===How do I create a new sector?===
Click at the [[#Where are the sector tabs?|sector tab]] area and select "New".
