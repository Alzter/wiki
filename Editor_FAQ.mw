== Generic ==
[[Image:EditorFAQ1.png|thumb|500px|Overview of the Editor, click to enlarge]]
=== How do I move around in a level? ===
Click and drag with the middle mouse button.

<br/>

== Tiles ==

=== How do I add tiles to a level ===
Click on the layer you want the tiles on and select the tile you want from the Tiles Tool.

=== How do I filter the the tiles so I can find a specific one? ===
With the Tiles tool selected, there is a combo box above the pane with all of the tiles in it. This combo box contains categories (called tile groups) which filter what is displayed in the pane.

=== How do I hide tile layers? ===
Click on the small eye ([[Image:EditorEyeIcon.png]]) in the layer listing to adjust how hidden a layer is. Options are shown, semitransparent, and hidden.

=== How should I place the tiles for the end-level structures? ===
The best way to learn this is to look at existing levels. For the exit tree in MS2 the best place to look at is levels/test/tree-exit.stl at this point. Also note that using tiles for triggering the end sequence, although still supported, is no longer necessary. See [[#What is the SequenceTrigger object for?|What is the SequenceTrigger object for?]]

=== How do I add a new tilemap? ===
[[Image:Tilemap.png|left]]
Select the tilemap object and place it like a normal object anywhere in the level. The result will be a new that a new tilemap is created.

<br/>

== Objects ==

=== How do I easily align an object to the grid? ===
Pux walks into Igloo / Exit). The sequence names for that are "endsequence" and "stoptux", respectively. Also, you can use "fireworks".

=== What is the SpawnPoint object for? ===
[[Image:Spawnpoint.png|left]] The SpawnPoint object is used to define places where Tux could "spawn". This is used to mark where Tux should start in the level, the destination of doors and more. The spawnpoint where Tux will start on loading the level must be named "main" and be in the sector called "main".

=== How do I change the background image? ===
Select "Background" in the sector objects view. There you can change it's properties, including what picture(s) should be ck on the [[#Where are the sector tabs?|tab for the sector]] and select "Resize".

=== How do I create a new sector? ===
Right click at the [[#Where are the sector tabs?|sector tab]] area and select "New".

=== How do I delete a sector? ===
Right click at the [[#Where are the sector tabs?|sector tab]] for the current sector and select "Delete".

<br/>

== Operating system specific notes ==

=== I'm on OpenSUSE and I get a message about that it couldn't load gtk-sharp ===
 Could not load file or assembly 'gtk-sharp, Version=2.10.0.0, 
 Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=35e10195dab3c99f' or one of its dependencies.
If you are on OpenSUSE and get a message like this you might want to try [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=211#481 this] and the note directly below it as well. 

We (the developers) are unable to reproduce the problem but we do not use OpenSUSE. Try asking the OpenSUSE developers about what is going on there.

=== Does the editor work under Mac OS X? ===
Yes, it does, but the setup is complex; you will have to do the following:
* install Apple's X11
* download and build Gtk and its dependencies (Glib, Pango, Cairo, Atk, Gdk and maybe more)
* download and build Mono and GTK#
* download and build the editor

Since the Mono project doesn't pre-package Gtk# and its dependencies with the OS X installer, we are unable to provide a nice editor package. Additionally, we offer no official support, so no one might be able to help you on the mailing list if the editor crashes due to an OS X-specific problem.

=== Does the editor work under Microsoft Windows Vista? ===
Yes, but it requires a complete setup. you will have to compile some GTK# programs amongst other things. We are able to provide a package.

<br />

== Bugs and Errors ==
{{Attention|s=For any bug reports where please provide the '''full backtrace''' (if one exists) when reporting at our [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/ bugtracker]}}

=== I get an error about "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" ===
This can be several things:
#Check that the paths to the supertux data directory and to supertux itself in the editor preferences are correct.
#If you run it under mono (unless you know that you don't do it, you probably do run it under mono) check that the mono version is at least [http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads 1.2.2.1].
