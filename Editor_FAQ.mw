==Generic==

===How do I move around in a level?===
Click and drag with the middle mouse button.

<br/>

==Tiles==

===How do I add tiles to a level===
Click on the layer you want the tiles on and select the tile you want from the Tiles Tool.

===How do I filter the the tiles so I can find a specific one?===
With the Tiles tool selected, there is a combo box above the pane with all of the tiles in it.  This combo box contains categories which filter what is displayed in the pane.

===How do I hide tile layers?===
Click on the small eye in the layer listing to adjust how hidden a layer is.  Options are shown, semitransparent, and hidden.

===How should I place the tiles for the end-level structures?===
The best way to learn this is to look at existing levels. For the exit tree in MS2 the best place to look at is levels/test/tree-exit.stl at this point. Also note that using tiles for triggering the end sequence, although still supported, is no longer necessary. See [[#What is the SequenceTrigger object for?|What is the SequenceTrigger object for?]]

===How should I place floor and earth tiles to be the most aesthetically pleasing?===

<br/>

==Objects==

===How do I easily align an object to the grid?===
Press the Control key while moving an object to snap to every 16 pixels.  Press the Shift key to snap to every 32 pixels.

===What is the SequenceTrigger object for?===
[[Image:Sequencetrigger.png|left]] The SequenceTrigger object is used to define the areas that start and stop the end sequence (Tux walks into Igloo / Exit). The sequence names for that are "endsequence" and "stoptux", respectively.

===What is the SpawnPoint object for?===
[[Image:Spawnpoint.png|left]] The SpawnPoint object is used to define places where Tux could "spawn". This is used to mark where Tux should start in the level, the destination of doors and more. The spawnpoint where Tux will start on loading the level must be named "main" and be in the sector called "main".

==Other tools==

===How do I use brushes?===
Brushes are used to clean up edge tiles. The brush tool does that by replacing a chosen 3x3 section of tiles with the best of several "good-looking" patterns stored in so-called brushes. Keep that in mind when working with brushes - a brush will never apply a pattern it does not know about.

There are already a few brushes in <tt>trunk/supertux-sharp/data/brushes</tt> <!-- TODO: change this to a more "useful" path. --> that know some valid patterns e.g. for earth tiles or snow tiles. Load one in the level and then drag it over tiles to correct edge tiles of rough tile "blocks".

Note that the brushes are incomplete, so you might need to fix some things manually. If you used a pattern a brush did not yet know, you can add it to the list of known patterns by dragging a selection around the new pattern(s) with your right mouse button. All patterns in the selected region will be added to the list of valid patterns for the currently loaded brush. Because patterns are currently 3x3 tiles in size, your selection obviously has to be at least 3x3 tiles big. Also don't forget to save afterwards or your changes will be lost when you deselect the brush.

To create a new brush you currently got to "train" an empty one:
#Make a level that looks good.
#Select the tilemap you placed those tiles in.
#Load the brush <tt>trunk/supertux-sharp/data/brushes/empty.csv</tt> <!-- TODO: change this to a more "useful" path. -->
#Right click and drag to select the area to get tiles from.
#*If you do that several times you wont owerwrite the currect patterns but instead add to them.
#*The minimum size for a selection that works is 3x3 tiles. 
#When you are finished save the brush.

Note that a good brush would need several thousand patterns.

==Sectors==

===How do I resize a sector?===
Right click on the [[#Where are the sector tabs?|tab for the sector]] and select "Resize".

===Where are the sector tabs?===
Near the top of the editor. The default sector in a level is called "main" and is the sector where the game will start.

===How do I create a new sector?===
Click at the [[#Where are the sector tabs?|sector tab]] area and select "New".
