SuperTux is a classic 2D jump'n run sidescroller game in a style
similar to the original SuperMario games. The Milestone1 release of
SuperTux features 9 enemies, 26 playable levels, software and OpenGL
rendering modes, configurable joystick and keyboard input, new music
and completely redone graphics. Together with a little story, we hope
to provide a good gaming experience with this first Milestone release.

The improvements in Milestone1 are in huge part the result of the work
done surrounding the [Game of the Month March
2004](http://www.happypenguin.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1240) event
on [happypenguin.org](http://www.happypenguin.org/).
