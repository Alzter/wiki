SuperTux is a classic 2D jump'n run sidescroller game in a style similar to the original SuperMario games. The Milestone 1 release of SuperTux features 9 enemies, 26 playable levels, software and OpenGL rendering modes, configurable joystick and keyboard input, new music and completely redone graphics. Together with a little story, we hope to provide a good gaming experience with this first Milestone release.

The improvements in Milestone 1 are in huge part the result of the work done surrounding the Game of the Month March 2004 event on happy-penguin.org.

Milestone 2 is currently work in progress. It features a complete make-over from M1, including all new graphics, SDL2 graphics rendering, built in addons and a ton more features. 

If you have paid for SuperTux, you have been ripped off. SuperTux is open source (if you haven't figured that out already) and completely free.
