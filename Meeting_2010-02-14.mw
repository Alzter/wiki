=== Who is who? ===

=== Project management ===

* (Unstable) Release
** ''Mathnerd314'': Release as-is
** ''WolfgangB'': Take care of the license of data files, then release
** ''octo'': Release as-is
** ''grumbel'': Against a release
* Licenses of data files ({{Bug|578}})
** ''grumbel'' suggested to move files with unknown license to a <code>non-free/</code> folder.
** ''octo's'' alternative would be to remove all files and announce to the mailing list that the authors should contact us with licensing information to have them included again.
** The author of a file can be determined from the [[DataFiles]], SVN log and/or the mailing list archives.
** The information should be made available in an <code>AUTHORS</code> file which should be included in a release tarball.
** Some sound files already do have a SVN property with licensing information.
* Semi-anonymous contributions (email/nick but no real name)
** Contributions with just a nick name are fine. Since nobody knew what there was to discuss, the matter has been dismissed.
* Google Code move
* Bug tracker workflow ({{Bug|580}})
