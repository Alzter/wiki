Simplicity should be kept in the game. Too many actions are often not a great thing.
How are the achievements of Blowflying, flapping (double jumping) and roping very different?
They all allow you to jump further - which running already does.

Maybe running could be taken out and replaced when something like Blowflying or flapping is introduced.

Possibly you could have flapping (double jumping) included as a normal action instead of running
