Release notes proposal (please fix spelling and improve style!):

Just in time for Christmas we bring you a preview of Supertux Milestone 2. It
doesn't contain all levels yet, the story isn't complete, but it is already fun
to play to play and test. This is also a call for artists and coders, if you
like the game in it's current state, join us and help us finishing the real Milestone 2!

The game features a new boss for world1, a brand new forest world with trampolines, switches, portable stones, upside-down levels, wind, moving platforms, new badguys, environment effects, lighting effects and much more...

The game engine is nearly completely rewritten. A new camera algorithm allows
scrolling in all four directions, OpenAL based sound system, OpenGL effects, slopes, scripting for dynamic level events and animations.
