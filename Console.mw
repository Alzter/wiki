{{Milestone 2}}
The Console is a panel normally hidden from view. Its usage is twofold:

* It displays informational, warning and error messages that occur during gameplay, alerting players of things like low diskspace, broken levels, ...
* It helps debug the engine and test levels by allowing direct execution of Squirrel script commands (see [[Scripting reference]])

The Console pops into view for a short time whenever new messages are printed. To review old messages and enter commands, the console needs to be activated.

To do so, you will have to run supertux using the <tt>--console</tt> option. The key assigned to opening the console can be changed in the keyboard setup as soon it is activated.

In Mac OS X, you must go to Home/Library/Application Support/SuperTux/config.txt and change (console #f) to (console #t). Reverse the change to remove the console

To disable the console again you have to edit the SuperTux configuration file <tt>~/.supertux2/config</tt> (<tt>%USERPROFILE%/.supertux2/config</tt> for Windows users). You may have to enable viewing hidden files or folders. Change 
  (console #t)
back to
  (console #f)

The default key to open the console is ^. You may change this in keyboard setup.
