{{Milestone 2}}
The Console is a panel normally hidden from view. Its usage is twofold:

* It displays informational, warning and error messages that occur during gameplay, alerting players of things like low diskspace, broken levels, ...
* It helps debug the engine and test levels by allowing direct execution of Squirrel script commands (see [[Scripting reference]])

The Console pops into view for a short time whenever new messages are printed. To review old messages and enter commands, the console needs to be activated.

To do so, you will have to run supertux using the <tt>--console</tt> option. The key assigned to opening the console can be changed in the keyboard setup as soon it is activated.

To disable the console again you  have to edit the SuperTux configuration file <tt>~/.supertux2/config</tt>. Change 
  (console #t)
back to
  (console #f)
