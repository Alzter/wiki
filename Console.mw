{{Milestone 2}}
The Console is a panel normally hidden from view. Its usage is twofold:

* It displays informational, warning and error messages that occur during gameplay, alerting players of things like low diskspace, broken levels, ...
* It helps debug the engine and test levels by allowing direct execution of Squirrel script commands (see [[Scripting reference]])

The Console pops into view for a short time whenever new messages are printed. To review old messages and enter commands, the console needs to be activated.

To do so, you will have to run supertux using the <tt>--console</tt> option. The key assigned to opening the console can be changed in the keyboard setup as soon it is activated. (Default of ^) Use <tt>--noconsole</tt> to disable it again.

To disable or enable the console if you don't want to pass command line parameters, you will have to edit the edit the SuperTux configuration file. Depending on your operating system, this varies:
{| border="1"
! align="left" | Operating System !! align="left" | Config file location
|-
| align="left" | Linux            || align="left" | ~/.supertux2/config
|-
| align="left" | Windows          || align="left" | %USERPROFILE%/.supertux2/config
|-
| align="left" | Mac OS X         || align="left" | Home/Library/Application Support/SuperTux/config.txt
|}

You may have to enable viewing hidden files or folders.
Anyway, open the file up with a text editor, and
  (console #t)
will enable the console, and 
  (console #f)
will disable the console. Find one to change it to the other.
