The Console is a panel normally hidden from view. Its usage is twofold:

* It displays informational, warning and error messages that occur during gameplay, alerting players of things like low diskspace, broken levels, ...
* It helps debug the engine and test levels by allowing direct execution of Squirrel script commands (see [[Scripting reference]])

The Console pops into view for a short time whenever new messages are printed. To review old messages and enter commands, the console needs to be activated.

By default no key is assigned to opening the console. This can be done by editing the SuperTux configuration file and adding a key binding for "console".
