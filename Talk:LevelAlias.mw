What exactly is this page for? [[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 01:22, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
:Simple, a way to find English name of a level for people to report a bug that developers can understand. If someone reports a bug in the level <name in some other language> most developers will be unable to understand what level that is. This page would need more work though. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 11:18, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

What's the encoding of this wiki? Isn't it UTF-8? Why there are so many characters displayed as <?> here? --[[User:Lsz|Lsz]] 01:08, 2 July 2008 (UTC)
:Probably because you don't have the required glyphs in your font. --[[User:62.214.243.103|62.214.243.103]] 17:35, 2 July 2008 (UTC)
