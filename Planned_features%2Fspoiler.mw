'''New signs'''[[Image:Signs.png|thumbnail|right|New signs prewiev]]
The run signs will no longer contain snow on the top to fit the forest theme. There will be also three new color signs, a sign that suggest waiting for a platform to avoid suicides at those places and a sign that suggests carrying a lantern.
