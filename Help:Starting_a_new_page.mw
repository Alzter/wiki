{{PD Help Page}}
There are several ways to start a new page.

== Using Wikilinks ==
MediaWiki makes it very easy to link wiki pages using a standard syntax (see [[Help:Links|Links]]). If you (or anyone else) creates a link to an article that doesn't exist yet, the link will be coloured red, <span style="color: #ba0000">like this</span>.

Clicking a red link, will take you to the edit page for the new article.  Simply type your text, click save and the new page will be created.

Once the page has been created, the link will change from <span style="color: #ba0000">red</span> to <span style="color: #002bb8;">blue</span> (<span style="color: #5a3696;">purple</span> for pages you've visited) indicating that the article now exists.

== Using the URL ==
You can use the wiki's URL for creating a new page. The URL to an article of the wiki is usually something like this:
*<code><nowiki>http://www.my-wiki.org/index.php/</nowiki>'''ARTICLE'''</code>
