= About this Document = 

This document is meant to give a reasonably detailed guide on what shall and shall not happen in Milestone 2. It is also intended as a complete replacement of other, incomplete or otherwise flawed, Milestone 2 documents floating around in this Wiki. This design document is written by Grumbel, question and comments are welcome, use the Talk page or the IRC channel for that. At the moment this document is a work-in-progress, meaning goals might change as time progresses. This document as not yet been approved by any other member of the SuperTux development stuff.

= Overview =

[[Image:Supertux-forest-2004-06-15.jpg|thumbnail|right|Concept Drawing]]

The goal of Milestone 2 is to add another island/theme to the world of SuperTux, namely the forest island, as well as improving on the short  commings that where present in [[Milestone_1_Analysis|Milestone 1]]. Together with the forest island the game will provide additional enemies and items that fit the forest islands look and setting. New actions for Tux might be provided as well, namely the backflip, butt-jump and the iceflower powerup.

= Story = 

The SuperTux game starts with Penny, Tux's girlfriend, getting captured by Nolok. After those events are shown in the intro the player takes control over Tux and has to guide him through around two dozen levels on a snowy island. At the end of the path on the island is a castle, which however doesn't contain Nolok, instead a Yeti will be provided as a final boss battle. After Tux has defeated the Yeti and received a secret letter from Penny explaining  where the got taken, Tux continues his journey over the sea to another island, one filled with forests, grass and green stuff. 

[[Image:Granito.png|thumbnail|left|Granito together with Tux]]
On arrival on the forest island Tux will be welcome by the Granitos, which happen to be the native inhabitants of the island. They explain Tux in a cutscene that Nolok has taken control over their island and its magic castle, thus turning a large part of the island into a ghost world. To enter the magic castle five keys are needed, those are however scattered across the island. After hearing their story Tux tells them that he will help and proceeds deeper down into the forest world. On his journey through the forest island Tux will meet both more friendly Granitos as well has a salesman in the form of a walrus which will either tell some more story or help Tux with extra items or guide him through a level (Granitos can walk over spikes, while Tux can't).

[[Image:Totem.jpg|thumbnail|right|80px|Totem]]
After having collected the five keys Tux is able to enter the magic castle where he will face the final boss in form of a magic Totem. After defeating the Totem, Tux will yet again receive a letter from Penny telling him on how to continue his journey.
<br clear="all" />

= Intro/Credits = 
[[Image:Introcutscene.png|thumbnail|left|Intro Storyboard]]
The text based intro and credits shall be replaced with cutscenes, showing the events that are described in the text. Instead of auto-scrolling text the game shall provide text that doesn't scroll, but instead only continues up on user interaction (i.e. press action button to see the next page of text). Text in cutscenes shall get printed  letter by letter to the screen to provide a sense of 'motion'. Voice over from a story-teller might be consideration, while Tux, Penny and Nolok itself shall remain without speech.

= Shop =

[[Image:Shopkeeper-sketch.jpg|thumbnail|right|Shop]]

The shop is a little house accessible via the worldmap, it provides the player with items, mini-games or other useful things. The shopkeeper is an old walrus with a beard. Different islands might provide different looking shopkeepers, all walrus, but adopted to the local environment.

<br clear="all" />


= General = 

* Tux run animation shall be rolled back to the single-sprite on that was used in Milestone 1, the current split-image animation is far inferior
* uni-solid tiles shall be provided for all tilesets
* multi-layer paralax scrolling background tilemaps shall be used in all levels
* menu system should be replaced/reworked
* save system could need a rework as well
* language shall be changable via the option menu, LANG environment variable shall only be used as default setting

= World 1 - Icyisland =

World 1, the icyisland, was released with Milestone 1, the intend of Milestone 2 is to adapt it to the new engine features as well as improving it by adding new enemies and new gameplay elements. While level structure might be recyclable in many places, it will often need structural improvements to provide real use of vertical and horizontal scrolling, instead of just locking the player in a horizontal-only scrolling level. Things that need to be done:
[[Image:Newpipe_blue.png|thumbnail|right|New Pipe Variations]]
* Jumpy shall be replaced with an enemy that fits better into the snow landscape, Jumpy himself shall be reused in a lava-like setting or in the bosses castle
* the walrus salesmen shall be added to the island
* some levels shall be separated out into optional paths, to provide a less linear path
* the old Milestone1 worldmap shall be used, not the one currently present in SVN
* an additional type of snowballs shall be provided to signal stay-on-platform behaviour (a bandana or something like that)
[[Image:Snowman-variations.png|thumbnail|right|Snowman]]
* a snowman enemy shall be added, a snowman is build out of a base body combined with a snowball head, if the body is destroyed, the snowman turns into a snowball
* iceblocks which will melt on contact with fire shall allow to lock paths in a level or lock secrets
* balanced platforms that start to rotate or move when Tux stands on them shall be provided
* water, in its simplistic tile form, shall be removed from all levels
* uni-solid/half-tiles shall be used to enhance the levels and provide optional paths
* bottom-less pits shall be either replaced by pits with spike at the bottom or allow Tux to climb back out of the pit
* there shall be auto-scrolling levels that force Tux to run by having a avalanche coming down behind him, the avalanche might either be simple snow or a large group of enemies
* the castle tileset shall be replaced with something that looks colder and features both snow and ice
* cave tileset shall be replaced with something that has a larger pattern, thus looks less ugly when tiled
* tiles picturing deadly spikes build out of ice shall be created

= World 2 - Forest =
[[Image:Forestworldoverview.jpg|thumbnail|right|Forest Overview]]

The forest island is split into different section, one being a classical forest, one being tree-tops, then a stone based section, followed by a dark ghost forest and finally the boss castle. Each section might feature separate tilesets for above or below ground action.

* enemies: owl, snail, greeny, plant, eater, spitter, mr tree, leafman, canon, spider, ladybugs, stony, walking bush, drop-down oak
* boss: totem

== World 2 Enemies ==

=== Snail ===
[[Image:Snail.png|thumbnail|right|Snail]]

When jumped up on the snail rolls into her house and thus becomes invincible as well as portable. Snail is a slow moving enemy. Snail might come in different sizes, especially larger ones then the standard 32x32 enemies.

<br clear="all" />

=== Fluffy ===
[[Image:Fluffy.png|thumbnail|right|Fluffy]]
Fluffy is a small enemy that moves around via little hop motions, jumping on him will kill him. 

<br clear="all" />

=== Owl ===
<br clear="all" />

=== Greeny ===
<br clear="all" />

=== Spitter ===
<br clear="all" />

=== Eater ===
[[Image:Eater.png|thumbnail|right|Eater]]
The Eater is a very small enemy, half the size of a snowball, he can however expand a lot. If Tux gets to close to him the Eater will open his mouth wide enough that he can devour Tux or even other badguys. He his not defeatable by jumping onto him, since he will then just eat Tux. Throwing stuff at him won't work either, since again he will just eat them.
<br clear="all" />

=== MrTree ===
[[Image:Mrtree.png|thumbnail|right]]
In its basic version MrTree behaves similary to the Iceblock and thus acts as its replacment in the forest world. He might however also come in stacked-versions, movment stays the same, but its height varies. When jumped up-on a stacked MrTree only the top most one is killed, the others stay untouched. Another variant to MrTree is the toupee one, he has 'green stuff' on its head which might protect him against a single jump, after that jump his green protection is destroyed an he becomes a basic MrTree. 

A last version of MrTree might come in large size.

<br clear="all" />

=== Leafman ===
<br clear="all" />

=== Canon ===
[[Image:Canon.png|thumbnail|right|Canon]]
The canon can be mounted on either static or rotatable pedestal. It shoots angry looking canonballs.

=== Oak ===

= Editor =

* editor needs a minimap, like Flexlay
* editor needs a grid, like Flexlay

= Open Questions =

Do we need a tree-top setting? Does it fit into the forest world (deciduous forest vs coniferous forest)?

Should stone tiles be separate from the rest or merged into the main forest tileset (as unisolid tiles)?

What contrib levels contain ideas that might be worth to recycle?
