'''Ghostly Tree''' is Mr Tree's counterpart in Ghost Forest.
Looks and behaves like Mr Tree, but it has a darker look (black/burnt wood, no leaves, red glowing eyes...) and has two ghostly lights instead of leafs. When jumped, he turns into a stump and releases two ghosts instead of two Ivies.

Possible look (note this is only a sketch):<br />
