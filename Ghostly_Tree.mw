'''Ghostly Tree''' is Mr Tree's counterpart in Ghost Forest.
Looks and behaves like MrTree, but it has a darker look (black/burnt wood, no leaves, red glowing eyes...) and has two ghostly lights instead of leafs. When jumped, he turns into a stump and releases two ghosts instead of two Ivies.

Possible look (note this is only a sketch):<br />

Possibly Ghostly Tree could have to thin branches on either side of him (the same goes for the normal Mr Tree) which Tux can stand on. A concept sketch:

When jumped on, Ghostly (or Spooky) could release two [[bats.]]
