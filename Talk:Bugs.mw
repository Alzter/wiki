This page is currently a mix of bugs and user comments on bugs. Anybody care to clean it up? :) - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 09:59, 5 Apr 2005 (BST)

Well actually we can leave it as is. But please don't fill support requests here! Only fill in things that are clearly real bugs (better ask in irc channel or mailing list first).


"If an enemy kills Tux and the user elects to abort the level before he falls off the screen, gameplay may continue with negative lives. This happens when Tux looses his last life."   i HAD THAT HAPPEN TO ME.
