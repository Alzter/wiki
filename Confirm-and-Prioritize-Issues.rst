Another important but relatively easy task is to confirm and prioritize new
issues as they're reported on GitHub.

Requirements
------------

- Run up-to-date `nightly builds <https://download.supertuxproject.org/download/>`__
  or your own up-to-date build from git
- Ideally, you also have a build of the latest release available to test the
  issue there as well
- You're comfortable running builds that might break
- You have a GitHub account and are familiar with the issue tracking system (see
  https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/ and
  https://help.github.com/articles/about-discussions-in-issues-and-pull-requests/)

Confirm Issues
--------------

Confirming issues simply means you go through the list of issues that were newly
created. You then attempt to reproduce the problem on your computer by following
the instructions to reproduce provided by the person reporting the issue.
Finally, comment on the issue and tell us whether or not you also experience the
issue.

This helps the developers to verify the validity of issues.

You can also check older issues to see if they've been fixed already without
someone closing the issue.

Prioritize Issues
-----------------

Prioritizing issues will help the developers to see what needs to be fixed first
and will also help us to choose easy issues for new contributors.

For example a crash on the main screen is way more important than a small glitch
in a single level that only few people will notice. Also, while small issues
will usually be fixed fast by the developers, we could also suggest these to new
contributors to get them started quickly. This will help the core developers
focus on more important and severe issues.

Simply leave a comment on the issue explaining how severe and important the
issue seems to be to you.
